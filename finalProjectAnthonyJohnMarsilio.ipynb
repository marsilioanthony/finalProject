The upper East Brach at Harvard is running 1720 cfs and 48 degrees while down at Fishs’ Eddy we have 2900 cfs and 50 degrees.  The mainstem at Lordville is running 5200 cfs and 52 degrees.  We are still seeing good numbers of bugs, typically getting started after noon between 1-2pm depending on the air temps.  You could see a variety of bugs with 18-20 Olives, #16-20 Blue Quills, #14-16 Hendricksons, #12-14 Quill Gordons, #10-12 March Browns, #18-20  Chimarra caddis and #14-16 Apple caddis as well.

The upper West at Stilesville is running 4380 cfs and down at Hale Eddy we have 6380 cfs.  The water up at Stilesville is still rising slowly, as the bubble of high water works its way over the reservoir.  The upper East at Harvard is running 3680 cfs and 7470 cfs down at Fishs’ Eddy.  The main Delaware at Lordville is running 15,800 cfs and dropping after cresting at around 22,000 cfs.  Streamer fishing is going to be the best bet with the given conditions. Side channels and slow water along the banks will be where where any fish rising will be found.  The high water won’t affect the bugs and as the fish get adjusted to the higher water the dry fly fishing will continue to get better.  </h1>\n",

The bugs have been about as good as they get the last few days, in most stretches, with the following.  #18-20 Olives, #16-20 Blue Quills, #14-16 Hendricksons, #12-14 Quill Gordons, #18-20 Chimarra caddis and #14-16 Apple caddis.  Rusty spinners are also a necessity and could drop any time during the day.  Spent-caddis are also an option on picky fish.  It looks like some rain moving in later tonight into tomorrow with minimal accumulation, so tomorrow looks good too.  Lotsa’ Luck</h1>\n",

We do have some warmer temps on the upper West Branch due to the spill coming over the reservoir, which won’t hurt the bug situation.  Pepacton reservoir feeding the East branch isn’t far from spilling at 99.8% and good water coming into the backside from the rains yesterday.  The upper West at Stilesville is running 907 cfs and 47 degrees and down at Hale Eddy we have 1190 cfs and 43 degrees.  The upper East at Harvard is running 502 cfs and 46 degrees while down at Fishs’ Eddy we have 1390 cfs  and 47 degrees.  The mainstem at Lordville is running 2780 cfs and 47 degrees.  Most anglers had a pretty good day yesterday with solid bugs from the afternoon on.  With the warmer water temps on the main and East they’ve been getting better larger bugs for a few weeks now.  That warm water on the upper West should help get the Hendricksons going in better numbers as we get into May.  You should see #18-20 Olives, #16-20 Blue Quills, #14-16 Hendricksons, #12-14 Quill Gordons and maybe some other larger bugs if you venture way down on the main.  We are also seeing some #18-20 Chimarra caddis and #14-16 Apple Caddis.  A good spent caddis pattern is always good if the fish get picky.  Before the hatches start the nymphing is hard to beat and with the cloud cover streamer fishing is also an option.  Lotsa’ Luck</h1>\n",

Bugs are right on schedule with #18-20 Olives, #16-20 Blue Quills, #14-16 Hendricksons and always have some rusty spinners in #14-18 to cover all bugs currently hatching.  The East and main are definitely seeing more Hendricksons due to the much warmer water temps over the last few weeks.

The last two days were very windy, which is always the toughest element to deal with and it was upstream.  The upper West Branch at Stilesville is now at 690 cfs and 41 degrees and down at Hale Eddy we have 1300 cfs and 45 degrees.  There’s some color at Hale Eddy but there’s still easily 2-3 feet of visibility and will clear up pretty quickly, which is unfortunate.  The upper East Branch at Harvard is 380 cfs and 52 degrees while downriver at Fishs’ Eddy we have 1570 cfs and 53 degrees.  The mainstem at Lordville is running 2100 cfs and 54 degrees.  The bugs won’t mind the stained water and we should continue to see good #18-20 Olives, #16-20 Blue Quills, #14-16 Hendricksons and always have some rusty spinners in #14-18 to cover all of the above.  We are also seeing some #18-20 Chimarra caddis and some #14-16 Apple caddis on the mainstem and East due to the warmer water temps.  We should have a good week ahead with normal April air temps.

The West up at Stilesville is running 700 cfs and 40 degrees and down at Hale Eddy we have 780 cfs and 41 degrees.

There are definitely more of and more consistent bigger bugs on the main and East due to water temp but the West is due to have some better Hendricksons any day now, especially when it’s pushing 80 degrees and that water temp rises.

Be on the lookout for #18-20 Blue Winged Olives, #16-20 Blue Quills, #14-16 Hendricksons, #12-14 Quill Gordons and some #18-20 Chimarra caddis.

The water flows have remained pretty steady over the last few days with the water temps dropping with the dropping air temps.  With the colder weather we still saw the bugs starting around the same time of day, around 2pm, with fish looking up as well.  The hatches have been wrapping up a bit earlier when the evening temp drops.  The flow up at Stilesville is running 703 cfs and 40 degrees and down at Hale Eddy we have 804 cfs and 40 degrees as well.

We are seeing #18-20 Blue Winged Olives, #16-20 Blue Quills, #14-16 Hendricksons and some #18-20 Chimarra caddis.  The fish definitely started to look up earlier this week as the bugs picked up.  The dry fly fishing has been starting around 2pm, give or take a bit, depending on where you’re at on the system.  The mainstem and East’s water temps have been quite a bit warmer, especially with the cooler air temps.  That 4-6 degree difference is huge this time of year.  The nymphing has been the way to go before the hatches get going.  The streamer fishing can also be good, especially since we have had some clouds the last couple days.  Once the sun comes out in the gin-clear water it becomes pretty tough.  Today looks like a bit warmer than yesterday and then back into the 60’s tomorrow.  Lotsa’ Luck</h1>\n",

It looks like fairly mild temps today, in the low-70’s, with good cloud cover.  The upper West Branch at Stilesville is running 700 cfs and 40 degrees and Hale Eddy is now at 820 cfs and 43 degrees.  The upper East at Harvard is running 180 cfs and 51 degrees and downriver at Fishs’ Eddy we have 711 cfs and 54 degrees.  The mainstem is now running 1800 cfs and 54 degrees.  For mid-April these are pretty good water temps, thanks to the warm weather of the last handful of days.  The clarity on all of the rivers remains very good.  We’re seeing the typical bugs for this time of year with #14-18 Black Stoneflies, #18-20 Blue Winged Olives, #16-18 Blue Quills, #14-16 Hendricksons and #12-14 Quill Gordons.  Thankfully, we’re still in the window where fish will typically eat a good-looking fly thats getting a proper drift over their heads with little hesitation.  A good stonefly pattern and a #16 mayfly emerger are typically all you’ll need.

The upper East at Harvard is down to 280 cfs and 49 degrees and down at Fishs’ Eddy we have 930 cfs and 55 degrees.  The mainstem at Lordville is running 2240 cfs and 53 this morning.

We are seeing the usual bugs for now with; #14-18 Black Stoneflies, #18-20 Blue Winged Olives, #16-18 Blue Quills and #14-16 Hendricksons.  We just started seeing the Blue Quills and Hendricksons and we had some decent spinners as well last night with the unseasonably warm weather.  Nymphing is going to remain the best way to catch fish until the afternoon when you can start to look for rising fish.  With less water for the fish to travel through and some clouds/rain the dry fly fishing should continue to steadily improve.  Air temps look to cool down to normal next week, which is a very good thing.  Lotsa’ Luck</h1>\n",

With the drop in the water over the last day we have a lot more wadeable water throughout the system.

The fishing has been pretty consistent with nymphing being the best bet until early afternoon when we are starting to see some #14-18 Stoneflies and some #18-20 Chimarra caddis.  You could also see some small BWO’s in the #18-20 range.  We should start to see some #16-18 Blue Quills and #12-14 Quill Gordons soon, especially with the warm weather and water temps which are going to get into the 50’s the next couple days.

The bugs have been decent in the afternoons with Stoneflies in the #14-18 range, which are bringing some fish to the surface from early afternoon into the evenings.  This time of year the fish don’t tend to stay up for long periods of time feeding, so getting on them quickly helps.  There are some small Chimarra caddis in the #18-20 range as well as Olives in the same size range and could be a factor if there aren’t the much bigger stoneflies around.  If the only dry have is a good stonefly imitation, a dark-bodied elk hair caddis, you’ll be fine.  The nymphing is going to be the way to go for most of the day with a variety of stoneflies and mayfly nymphs tied to get down in the heavy water.  Streamer fishing is an option but the conditions are the opposite of ideal with the high sun and gin-clear water.  It can still work and any periods with lower light will help.

This time of year the fish might not stay up long but if you get a good drift over them while they’re feeding they will eat.

Along with the stoneflies in size #14-20 there are lots of Chimarra caddis in #16-18.  You likely won’t see fish keying in on anything on top other than the stoneflies while they are still around in the current numbers.  The streamer fishing can be decent, especially if you get some good cloud cover.  With the super-clear water the streamer fishing is going to be tough if you have high sun, as it always will be.

Fishing has still been pretty good, especially for mid-October and low water.  The nymphing has been pretty consistent lately with and definitely the most consistent method of fishing at least until we get into the afternoons and typically find some rising fish.  For the bugs in the afternoons, look for small #18-22 Blue Winged Olives and their spinners-small rustys, #12 Isonychia and some #16-18 hebes down on the main and East Branch.  Streamers could be an option down on the mainstem as it rises and gets color, which should last through the weekend.  Lotsa’ Luck </h1>\n",

Nymphing has been solid lately with a variety on nymphs in the #14-18 range and a little color to your flies doesn’t hurt.  The bugs are typically showing up in early afternoon and small Blue Winged Olives in the #18-24 range are the most prevalent bug around.  Little rusty spinners in the same size are great bugs as well.  There are some small hebes in the #16-18 range have also been pretty good in the afternoons, especially down on the mainstem.

We had some decent bugs and rising fish yesterday on all of the rivers with small BWO’s being the most prevalent bug this time of year.  Small rusty spinners in the same size range, #18-24, are also great patterns any time of the day and are especially nice on fussy fish.  We’re still seeing the early-fall smattering of other bugs like #12 Isonychia, #16-18 hebes along with a few #14 summer Cahills.  Some of those bigger bugs are also great to blind-cast, gridding the water looking for an opportunistic fish.  They also support a dropper well if you don’t want to stare at an indicator.  It’s a nice time of year to get out and explore your favorite water.  It’s best not to get caught up on the lower flows, thinking that the fishing will suffer, there’s plenty of good fishing to be had and some great views as well.  Lotsa’ Luck </h1>\n",

Various nymphs in the #14-18 range like pheasant tails, perdigons, frenchies, and Isonychia-specific patterns are all good choices.

The fishing is pretty typical for fall on the Delaware and a lot of your luck depends on what weather the day brings.  Lotsa’ Luck</p>\n",

The flows are pretty much where they’ve been the last couple days without rain.  The upper West Branch at Stilesville is running 376 cfs and 51 degrees and down at Hale Eddy we have 529 cfs and 52 degrees.  The upper East Branch at Harvard is running 292 cfs and 53 degrees and downriver at Fishs’ Eddy we have 822 cfs and 56 degrees.  The upper mainstem down at Lordville is running 1700 cfs and 59 degrees.  The fishing lately has been pretty good for mid-September, especially nymphing, but the bugs on top have been pretty slow during the day.  These cooler nights as we make the transition into fall should help as the water temps drop.  The rivers are all pretty clear other than the upper West Branch that’s running slightly dirty due to the release from Cannonsville reservoir, which is typical as we get into the fall.  Nymphing, using a variety of bugs in the 14-18 range has been very productive throughout the day.  Lately, we haven’t had a ton of bugs until right at dark but if you do get into some steadily rising fish they’re likely eating small Blue Winged Olives in the #18-24 range and their small rusty spinners.  We are still seeing a few random summer stenos in the #14-16 range, #16-18 hebes and down on the mainstem a few #10-12 Isonychia and #12 White Flies.  Blind-casting any of these larger bugs can be productive if nymphing isn’t your thing.  If we get some rain the streamer fishing could turn on but overall it’s very slow in the bright sun and clear water. Lotsa’ Luck</p>\n",

With conditions remaining pretty consistent the last few days not much is going to change as far as fishing and the bugs unless we get some heavier rain and some color to the water.  Olives in #18-24 are going to be your best bet on most fish.  You can typically get away with an Olive in the #18-20 range.  Small winged ants in the same size range are hard to beat on a fish that’s consistently rising.  The bigger summer stenos and Isonychia are good for blind casting, especially if you’re moving in a boat.  Droppers off of those same bugs are good options too if you don’t want to run an indicator, which is also working well.  Streamers can be productive this time of year and will depend  a lot on the current conditions.  A bit of rain today and tomorrow would be perfect.  Lotsa’ Luck</p>\n",

We are a few other random some other bugs like summer stenos in #14-16, hebes in #16-18, #12 Isonychia and small winged ants in the #18-24 range.  Streamer fishing this time of year can be good, especially with the right conditions like low light, a little stain to the water etc.  It looks like a chance of rain the next two days, which is great and will help keep water levels up with the higher release levels a thing of the past with the current reservoir levels.

The water on the West Branch is running a bit warmer than it’s usual release temps due to the reservoir levels getting lower after months of sucking the colder layers from the bottom.  We are still seeing the same bugs but the midday hatches have slowed due to the water temps.  If you find steadily rising fish it’s likely going to be eating small Blue Winged Olives or winged ants in the #18-24 range.  There has been some Tricos and their spinners in the mornings too, until the sun really comes out for the day.  Streamers are still an option but the water is getting pretty clear for any midday action.  Nymphing is going to be your best bet during the day and it’s been pretty good lately.

There are plenty of small rusty spinners on the water this morning but are great flies any time of the day you find fish rising.  Most of the hatching will be from afternoon into evening.  We are still seeing a few scattered larger summer Cahills in the #14 range and smaller hebes in #16-18.  The nymphing has been solid for the last month or so with many options in the #12-18 size range.  Streamer fishing has been decent to very good lately, it just depends on the day and conditions.

Up at Stilesville on the upper West Branch we have 376 cfs, basically what it was flowing pre-rain, and 51 degrees.  Downriver at Hale Eddy we have 1440 cfs and dropping quickly and 60 degrees due to the warm rain water and runoff.  The East Branch and it’s tribs finally got some rain.  Harvard on the upper East is running 2160 cfs and 62 degrees and downriver at Fishs’ Eddy we have 3540 cfs and 62 degrees.  The main Delaware at Lordville is running 5360 cfs and 64 degrees and will be rising for a while.  As far as wadeable water the upper West Branch above Deposit is going the be the best bet.  There is some color to the river on the West bank from Cold Spring Creek that enters the river right above the Stilesville access point.  From there, several miles down, until you hit Oquaga creek on the West bank of the river it’s going to be fairly low and much clearer than below Oquaga.  As you move downriver towards Hale Eddy the water eventually mixes and is pretty stained at the moment but is dropping quickly and will be fished today for sure.  It does look like the vast majority of the storm is passed us but we may get some light rain throughout the day.

Today, and probably tomorrow depending on what rain actually hits us, should be good days to be out with light rain and currently there’s zero impact to the river from the rain overnight.

With the water on the higher side and some fall-stain to it, bugs in the #14-16 range, even with a bit of color or flash, have been working well.  You could see a few Sulphurs lingering on the upper West Branch but they are pretty much a wrap for the year.  The Blue Winged Olives in #18-24 are likely to be what the fish are eating, especially if you find a steady riser.  Their small rusty spinners are also hard to beat any time of the day you find some risers.  Scattered in the afternoons you could also find a few #16 Cahills, #16-18 hebes and #12 Isonychia.  Winged ants in #18-24 are also good bugs to have and can show up in good numbers on the water.

So far, we’ve got very little rain with the cells that passed through last night.  They have got enough water from the multiple cells passing by to help meet the minimum flows downriver, which has allowed them to cut the flows back on the release into the West Branch.  The upper West at Stilesville is running 463 this morning and 49 degrees and down at Hale Eddy we have 485 cfs and 50 degrees.  The upper East is now 151 cfs at Harvard and 58 degrees.  The lower East at Fishs’ Eddy is running 235 cfs and 67 degrees.  The main Delaware at Lordville is running 907 cfs and 62 degrees.  Today should be a good day to be on the water with off-and-on rain most of the day with little chance of the water rising much or getting too stained.  It also looks like a great Blue Winged Olive day, especially from afternoon on.  Today should also be a good chance to throw some streamers with the low light and rain.  Tomorrow looks pretty good too as far as the weather goes with mild temps and some possible rain.  Lotsa’ Luck</p>\n",

Flows today will likely be just a bit lower than they have been the last few days with 896 cfs and 48 degrees currently up at Stilesville.  In a move that doesn’t make much sense they did lower the release upriver, around midnight, to about 650 cfs but now it’s being raised to where it currently is.  The powers to be likely thought we were going to get more rain in the system than what actually fell and raised the water back up once they realized it didn’t happen.  Hale Eddy is running 680 cfs and 49 degrees this morning and is rising to what will be over 900 cfs here in a few hours.  Overall, the fluctuating release shouldn’t affect the quality of the fishing today and it’s been pretty solid lately.  The upper East Branch at Harvard is now running 143 cfs and 61 degrees and downriver at Fishs’ Eddy we have 216 cfs and 68 degrees.  The main Delaware is running 1060 cfs and 61 degrees this morning.  With the Sulphurs winding up for the season, other than way up river where you’ll see a few, our late summer bugs like #18-24 BWO’s, #14 Caihills, #12 Isonychia and #16-18 hebes are scattered around enough to bring fish to the surface.  There are also some tricos around in the mornings especially on rivers with lower, warmer flows than the West Branch.  The nymphing, both with an indicator and run off of a dry fly as a dropper, are working very well with variety of patterns producing.  Streamer fishing in the higher and slightly dirty water is also productive at times and smaller is typically better.  Lotsa’ Luck</p>\n",

The main Delaware at Lordville is running 1390 cfs and 61 degrees this morning.  There are a few Sulphurs up top, around Deposit, as that hatch winds up for the year.

We’re also seeing some #12 Isonychia around too as well as a few #14 Cahills and #16-18 hebes.  The larger bugs are good options for the dry droppers which are working very well this time of year.

The upper West Branch at Stilesville is running 978 cfs and 50 degrees and down at Hale Eddy we have 1020 cfs and 52 degrees.  The West Branch has some color to it from the release as it appears the reservoir is turning over, which typically happens this time of year.

The main Delaware down at Lordville the flow is 1520 cfs and 60 degrees, an excellent temp for mid-August.  The fishing has been very good lately, about as good as it will ever be this time of year.  The Sulphurs are winding down up around Deposit but you will still see a few.  The Blue Winged Olives in #18-24 have been great and will be a staple for the rest of the year.  We are still getting some #14-16 Cahills and #10-12 Isonychia as well.  Those larger bugs are great for running a dropper too.  Lots of nymphs are working well with pheasant tails, frenchies and some larger Isonycia patterns at the top.  Something with a bit of flash or color to it helps in the turbid water.

The upper West Branch at Stilesville is running 1110 cfs and 47 degrees and down at Hale Eddy we have 1140 cfs and 48 degrees.  The East is still running low and warm with 151 cfs and 55 degrees at Harvard and down at Fishs’ Eddy we have 214 cfs and 64 degrees.  The main Delaware down at Lordville is running 991 cfs and 61 degrees.  With the high water, which started yesterday, the fishing was pretty good from late-morning on.  We are still getting some #18-20 Sulphurs on the upper West Branch.  The small Olives in #18-24 are also essential bugs for the next few months as well as their small rusty spinners.  Small nymphs representing the Sulphurs and Olives are also working well.  Some #12 Isonychia and #14 Cahills are great flies to grid the water with and also work well to run a dropper off of.  The water is pretty clear but with the increased volume some streamer fishing could be productive, especially during periods of low light.

With the very dry conditions we’ve had lately the downriver flows in NJ are getting to the level where they need to release water into the West Branch to keep those levels up.  Currently at Stilesville on the upper West Branch we have 919 cfs and 47 degrees and down at Hale Eddy we have 943 cfs and 48 degrees.  The upper East is still steady at 151 cfs and 57 at Harvard and down at Fishs’ Eddy we have 214 cfs and 65 degrees.  The main Delaware at Lordville is running 1000 cfs and 63 degrees.  With the increased water on the West Branch there is still quite a bit of wading opportunity in most spots and it’s much nicer to row a boat in.  Fishing should remain pretty steady with the tail end of the season’s #18-20 Sulphurs still coming off upriver, around Deposit, starting in the early afternoon.  Small Olives, from #20-24, are also bugs you’ll have to have, even on the bright and sunny days.  For some larger bugs the Isonychia in #10-12 and #14 Cahills are great choices still.  #18 Sulphur-specific or Pheasant tail nymphs are hard to be when nymphing or running as a dropper, pretty much all day.  It doesn’t look like too much rain in the immediate forecast so flows should stay steady until we do get some precipitation somewhere along the Delaware.  Lotsa’ Luck</p>\n",

As far as flows and temps nothing  has really changed other than slightly cooler water on the East and mainstem.  They have kept the increased water coming out of Cannonsville, into the West Branch, going steady with 625 cfs here at Hale Eddy.  That’s a great level for the West Branch, making it a bit easier to navigate in a boat and is also very wadeable.  We are still getting some Sulphurs, especially on the upper West Branch, but they are starting to slow down which is pretty typical this time of year.  Small Blue Winged Olives and terrestrials will be good bugs for the next month as well.   A few Isonychia and Cahills are around and make good blind casting bugs, especially when moving over water in a boat.

Running droppers and nymphing has also been very productive, both before and during the hatch.  There are a few Isonychia out there too, which always make great blind-casting bugs both with or without a dropper.

The hatch has been starting around noon on most days with bugs going through the evening.  We should have some decent Blue Winged Olives mixed in too, especially with the cloud cover we’ve got.

There isn’t a lot to report since we’ve had identical conditions and bugs over the last few weeks.  But, that’s good because for mid-August we have pretty good hatches of Sulphurs kicking off midday up around Deposit.  The fish are in their typical summer Sulphur mood and are about as picky as fish can get while eating dry flies.  You want to have some select Sulphur patterns in #18-20 along with some nymphs to use as droppers and spinners for the evenings.  Small Olives and terrestrials are oftentimes good flies to use during the Sulphur hatch and same goes for some small rusty spinners for the Olives.  A #22 Rusty Spinner is a common bug to be found on the water at any time of the day and the big, fussy fish know that.  It looks like warm weather, getting near 90 degrees, the next few days with a chance of storm in the afternoons.  From Tuesday on the highs are a bit cooler, below 80, which we will take.

The water on the West is still running a bit higher due to a thermal release last night.  The water up at Stilesville is about what it has been and Hale Eddy will follow shortly.  The upper West at Stilesville is 686 cfs and 47 degrees and down at Hale Eddy we have 1090 cfs and 48 degrees.  The upper East is running 165 cfs and 60 degrees at Harvard and down at Fishs’ Eddy we have 261 cfs and 71 degrees.  The main Delaware at Lordville is running 1620 cfs and 68 degrees.  The upper West Branch is the place to be this time of year and the #18-20 Sulphurs have been pretty good with the hatch typically starting around noon. The fish are notoriously tough and you’ll need your best flies, both dries and nymphs, long leaders and precise casts.  There are also some #10-12 Isonychia and #14 Cahills that are great blind casting bugs and are also great for running a dropper.  Terrestrials, like ants and beetles, are also great bugs for the next few months.  It doesn’t look like much rain anytime soon but maybe a bit tomorrow afternoon and Monday.  Lotsa’ Luck</p>\n",

We ended up getting very little rain yesterday out of the large storm that passed through the area, leaving water levels where they have been all month.  The upper West Branch is running 496 cfs and 46 degrees and down at Hale Eddy we have 534 cfs and 48 degrees.  The upper East Branch at Harvard is 179 cfs and 58 degrees and down at Fishs’ Eddy we have 316 cfs and 68 degrees.  The main Delaware at Lordville is now at 1080 cfs and 66 degrees.  With the sunny skies and warm temps the upper West is going to be the best bet until we get towards evening.  We are still in the middle of the small Sulphurs in the #18-20 ranges which we’ll see in the early afternoon, mixed with a few small #18-24 Blue Winged Olives.  These summer conditions make for some tricky fish but we are lucky to have some midday targets.  Sparse and buggy cripples, emergers, droppers and spinners are must-have flies to throw at these fish.  If the fish seem to be feeding subsurface, ie. you see random body parts other than a mouth, small little pheasant tails or Sulphur nymphs work great as droppers.  6X tippet is going to be necessary and maybe even 7X if you trust yourself will also help get a better drift with the smaller flies.  The larger Isonychia and Cahills also make some decent bugs to cover water and run a dropper.  The weather and conditions look pretty similar all week, with little rain in the immediate forecast.

It should be a good day for the bugs with the light drizzle and good cloud cover.  We will still have some Sulphurs in the early afternoon along with some Blue Winged Olives, which it’s a perfect day for.

Yesterday fished pretty well with the typical #18-20 Sulphurs starting upriver in the early afternoon.  Mixed in with the prolific Sulphurs are a few #10-12 Isonychia and #14 Cahills.  These bigger flies are also nice to run a dropper off of, typically a smaller nymph to imitate the Sulphurs.  Running a similar dropper off of a #18 Sulphur is also very effective as a lot of the fish are taking the emerging bugs right below the surface.  Terrestrials, like ants and beetles, are hard to beat in these summer months.  If we do get some rain out of this storm we could have some nice water for streamers, especially tomorrow as the water is rising.  Lotsa’ Luck</p>\n",

The upper four to five miles of the West Branch is going to have much better bugs than what you will see as you head downriver, with very few bugs midday below that area, unless we get some good cloudy/rainy weather which typically leads to good Blue Winged Olives in #18-24 range.  The Olives are also good to have up around Deposit, even on the sunny days.  We are seeing some #10-12 Isonychia and #14 Cahills randomly throughout the river and they are always nice to grid the water with, and run a dropper off of if needed.

The fish are notoriously picky on the Sulphurs, so having a good selection of sparse emergers, cripples and spinners will be needed.  Little Blue Winged Olives, in the 18-24 size range, are also around most days and can be really good if we do get some cloud cover and rain.  Little Rusty spinners for the BWO’s are good bugs to have for the last few hours of daylight and can even be present midday.  For the Sulphur spinners, which will be around the last hour or so of light, mixed in with the duns are also great flies to run as the evening is wrapping up.  We are seeing a few larger Isonychia in #10-12 and some #14 Cahills mixed in with the smaller bugs and area always great blind-casting options.

As usual, the upper portion of the West Branch is producing the best bugs with #16-20 Sulphurs starting in early afternoon and there are typically some decent Olives in #18-24 mixed in as well.  There are also a few Isonychia in #10-12 randomly hatching through the system, same for a few #14 Cahills.  Spinners of the above the bugs are also essential, with small ginger spinners for the Sulphurs and Cahills and rustys for the BWO’s and Isonychia.

The upper West at Stilesville is running 496 cfs and 45 degrees and down at Hale Eddy we have 802 cfs and 52 degrees with a slight tint at the bridge.  The upper East Branch at Harvard is running 292 cfs and 56 degrees and downriver at Fishs’ Eddy we have 1040 cfs and 59 degrees.  The mainstem down at Lordville is running 3100 cfs and 62 degrees going into the weekend.  We had some good streamer water yesterday with upriver being the best bet with the stained water, which mixed and became pretty dirty as you traveled downriver.  With the water dropping we should see a pickup in the surface activity with #14-20 Sulphurs, #18-22 Blue Winged Olives, #10-12 Isonychia and the spinners of the above bugs, typically in the evenings.  On the very warm mornings we have seen some decent activity lately for a few hours on top with leftover spinners, spent caddis or random terrestrials.  The morning streamer fishing can also be very productive from sunrise until the sun really comes out, depending on the weather.  The next two days look to be quite a bit cooler, with highs in the low-60’s and 40’s overnight.  Lotsa’ Luck </p>\n",

The report isn’t likely to change unless the conditions do via some decent rain that rolls through or until later this month when the smaller Sulphurs really pick up on the upper West Branch.  It has been worth being out in the mornings, especially if it stays warm like it did last night.  You can typically find some consistent targets on top, trash feeding on leftover bugs and spinners from the previous day.  Good morning flies are small spinners, ginger or rusty this time of year, or maybe a small spent-caddis or terrestrial as the temps warm.  Ants and beetles are always good morning flies.  As far as bugs in the afternoons, #14-18 Sulphurs are typically starting between 2-3pm, #18-22 Blue Winged Olives, #10-12 Isonychia sporadicly and maybe a #14 Grey Fox or two.  Even when the hatching is sparse this time of year, blind-casting a visible dry fly and a dropper is a great method to drum up fish if nymphing isn’t your thing.  Tomorrow looks like very similar weather with temps in the 80’s and a chance of rain on Thursday morning and night.  Lotsa’ Luck</p>\n",

The cooler night temperatures have definitely helped keep the downriver water temps low, with all of the Delaware rivers under 60 degrees to start the day.  The water levels are running pretty consistent, dropping a bit after the rains earlier this week.  The upper West Branch at Stilesville is now at 487 cfs and 44 degrees and down at Hale Eddy we have 620 cfs and 47 degrees.  The upper East Branch at Harvard is running 451 cfs and 51 degrees and downriver at Fishs’ Eddy we have 1500 cfs and 57.  The mainstem downriver at Lordville is now running 2630 cfs and 57 degrees.  We are still seeing #14-18 Sulphurs through the system, with the most consistent hatches being on the West Branch, pretty typical this time of year as we head into summer.  Blind casting, if there’s not a noticeable hatch, has been working with either Sulphurs or also with larger bugs like #10-12 Isonychia or #12-14 March Browns/Grey Fox.  Even in the bright sun, Blue Winged Olives in #18-22 are great flies to have, even during a decent hatch of other mayflies.  Blind casting with a visible dry fly and dropper has also been working if there aren’t many bugs on the water.  The streamer fishing was decent at times after the rains this week and may turn back on after the rain we are forecast to get tomorrow.

After on-and-off light rain the last few days the rivers still have a bit of stain to them and are dropping slowly back to pre-rain flows.

The streamer fishing has been decent, especially early and late in the day, durning lower light situations.  There has also been some trash-feeding fish early in the mornings, typically wrapping up by 10 or 11 am.  A small Sulphur spinner in #14-18 or spent caddis will typically work on these fish.  We are seeing a few bugs mid-day but this time of year can be slow on the bright and sunny days.  Blind casting a nice and visible Sulphur emerger, March Brown or Isonychia can work to drum fish up.  Running a small #16-18 nymph dropper off the back can also work very well, especially if you’re seeing fish nymphing during the day.  Towards dark we typically see a decent hatch of #14-18 Sulphurs and some various spinner of the bugs mentioned above.

It looks like some rain this afternoon, around 5pm, then cooler temps the next few days and nights.  We did get a slight boost in release water from Cannonsville, into the West Branch, that started yesterday.  It’s currently 440 cfs up at Stilesville and every little bit helps.  Down river at Hale Eddy we have 569 cfs and 49 degrees.  The upper East at Harvard is running 341 cfs and 60 degrees and down at Fishs’ Eddy we have 807 cfs and 64 degrees.  The main Delaware at Lordville is running 1640 cfs and 66 degrees.  We’ve been seeing pretty good bugs lately but yesterday was a bit tougher mid-day with the 90 degrees and high sun which isn’t too surprising.  We should get some cloud cover moving in this afternoon before the possibility of rain around 2-3pm.  We are still seeing #18-20 Blue Winged Olives, #10-12 March Browns /#12-14 Grey Fox, #14-16 Hendricksons (especially up on the West),#14-16 Sulphurs (downriver),#14-16 Apple Caddis and #18-20 Chimarra caddis on the water.  Rusty spinners in #10-20 as well for the spinner falls throughout the system.  A few spent caddis patterns in the #16-20 range can also be effective with the heavy caddis hatches we’ve been seeing or when you encounter a mid-day garbage feeder.  Lots’a Luck</p>\n",

With these warmer days water temps are starting to creep up in to the upper 40’s and we are starting to see good bugs on the water.

The rivers are still pretty high from the big storm that hit late last week but the rivers are all clearing up nicely and dropping quickly.  The tailwaters (East and West Branches) are going to drop slower due to the water coming over the dams from the reservoirs.  Anglers will be fishing today from boats and will do very well.  Almost entirely with streamers at these water levels, very common for this time of year.

With the dropping of the rivers and good clarity we’ll be fishing very soon, probably tomorrow and the streamer fishing is going to be good.  A lot of extra bait has been and is being washed into the system and the fish are going to be fat and happy, pushed against he bank making up for lost meals.  Streamers are going to be where it’s at for a while with this volume of water.  With all of the fishing being done out of a boat for the foreseeable future, a six or seven weight paired with a nice sink tip line is going to be the best tool for the job.  With the warmer weather coming up this week we will definitely see more bugs with stoneflies and small Baetis still on the menu and as the week and warmth progresses maybe some Quill Gordons and Blue Quills.

      "</h1><p class=\"\" style=\"white-space:pre-wrap;\">We got hit with the rain storm that came across the whole East coast yesterday and the hours of heavy rain brought all rivers in the area up significantly.  We’re currently looking at very high water throughout the system and are running dirty at the moment.  How quickly they clear will depend on future rain.  As far as dropping, the tailwaters are not going to drop significantly any time soon with the high volume of water coming into the back side of the reservoirs.  They will actually continue to rise over the next few days despite any future precipitation.  They could clear and offer some good fishing from a boat very soon if we don’t get blasted again in the next few days.  As far as wade fishing, typical this time of year, it’s going to be a while.  The upper West Branch at  Stilesville is running 5410 with 39 degree water.  Downriver at Hale Eddy we have 7630 cfs and 40 degrees.  The upper East Branch at Harvard is now at 11,300 and 40 degrees.  The lower East at Fishs’ Eddy is running 27,200 cfs and 40 degrees.  The main Delaware at Lordville is at 42,300 cfs and 42 degrees.  All we can do now is hope for some clear skies which will all ow the river to clear and we will have some great streamer fishing.  With the spilling reservoirs we are going to have some alewyves in the river and the fish are getting fat.  Lotsa’ Luck</p>\n",

The rivers did continue to rise overnight with the weekend’s rains and the water coming in from the backside of the reservoirs.  Despite to snow and colder weather the river did fish well with streamers over the weekend. The flow up at Stilesville is now 2420 cfs and 38 degrees while down at Hale Eddy we have 2760 cfs and 38 degrees.  The East Branch up at Harvard is now at 2490 cfs and 38 degrees and down below the Beaverkill at Fishs’ Eddy we have 4080 cfs and 39 degrees.  The main Delaware at Lordville is now at 6630 cfs and 38 degrees.  With the higher water boats are going to be a necessity for quite some time.  The rivers are currently in great shape with good visibility and a bit of stain.  We are supposed to get some decent rain mid-week which will keep the flows up for the foreseeable future.  The fish are seeing a decent number of streamers cast against the banks so sparse, smaller flies usually work best.  Any bugs on top will be stoneflies in #16-22 with some small Baetis mixed in as well.  Lotsa’ Luck</p>\n",

      "</h1><p class=\"\" style=\"white-space:pre-wrap;\">As we enter another season on the Delaware we have typical early-spring conditions here with snow this morning and high water throughout the system.  There is a bit of color to the water but for early April the conditions are perfect with both reservoirs spilling.  With the short-term forecast this week, calling for a rainy week, they will be spilling for a some time with wading conditions on the Delaware non-existent for a while.  The flow up at Stilesville is currently 2170 cfs and 38 degrees and down at Hale Eddy we have 2560 cfs and 38 degrees.  The upper East Branch at Harvard we have 2720 cfs and 38 degrees.  Down on the lower East at Fishs’ Eddy we have 4650 cfs and 39 degrees.  The main Delaware at Lordville is running 6890 cfs and 40 degrees.   Over the past few weeks we’ve had some decent weather mixed in and the fishing has been very good for early spring with plenty of healthy fish, which have benefitted from the high water.  Streamer fishing from a drift boat has been the go-to method to cover water lately with a wide variety of colors and styles working lately.  A good sink tip line on a 6 or 7wt is your best bet, allowing you to get down and fish some lighter flies too.  We have been seeing some small #16-22 Black Stoneflies in the afternoons for a few weeks now, with a few fish coming up in the slower water if you’re lucky.  If you do find some fish on top it’s important to get on them quick as they don’t rise too many times this time of year.  Typically they’ll eat two or three times and stay down for a while.  If you do see any mayflies they’re going to be small Baetis, or Blue Winged Olives, in the #20-24 range.  We should start seeing some Blue Quills and Quill Gordons towards the middle of the month.  Lotsa’ Luck</p>\n",

It doesn’t look like too much accumulation with the rain and it looks to clear up tomorrow with slightly warmer temps and clear skies.  The flows are dropping slowly after the rain we got Friday night and clearing as well.  Up at Stilesville we are still looking at 863 cfs adn 61 degrees and down at Hale Eddy we have 1360 cfs and 56 degrees.  Even though the upper river is open for the first time ever, this time of year, our guides are leaving the spawning fish alone and won’t go above the PA border during trips.  The upper East Branch at Harvard is running 877 cfs and 50 degrees while down at Fishs’ Eddy we have 1660 cfs and 50 degrees.  The main Delaware at Lordville is running 3340 cfs and 54 degrees.  The streamer fishing was decent this weekend with the extra stain to the water, especially if you had some cloud cover.  A few Blue Winged Olives in the afternoons are typically around in the slower water, often against the banks.  Nymphing has been the most consistent method as the dries are petering out as the season goes on.  Lotsa’ Luck  </p>\n",

The upper West Branch at Stilesville is running 863 cfs and 61 degrees and down at Hale Eddy we have 1630 cfs and 55 degrees.  Here at the bridge there is a decent stain to the water with a couple feet of visibility, clear enough for all types of fishing.  The upper East went up a bit a Harvard and is currently flowing 959 cfs and 48 degrees.  Down at Fishs’ Eddy the flow is 2080 cfs and 53 degrees.  Down on the main Delaware at Lordville we have 4300 cfs and 57 degrees.  With the added stain to the water the next few days should be great to throw some streamers and it does look like  a possibility of rain later this afternoon.  We could see some Blue Winged Olives later today along with an Isonychia here and there.  It looks like much cooler weather for the rest of the week with highs in the 60’s.  Lotsa’ Luck</p>\n",

Current forecasts are estimating an inch of rain from the upcoming storm which will keep flows high for a while, if not from the rain at least from the high releases we’ve had the last couple months.  Current flows are still holding steady where they’ve been the last few months.   Stilesville on the upper West is running 863 cfs and 62 degrees and down at Hale Eddy we have 1030 cfs and 57 degrees with a pretty good stain to the water from the reservoir turning over.  The upper East is running clear with 793 cfs and 48 degrees up at Harvard.  Downriver at Fishs’ Eddy 1410 cfs and 54 degrees.  On the main Delaware down at Lordville we have 2520 cfs and 59 degrees and is running clearer, especially the farther you travel downriver.  With the rain coming in we could have some good streamer opportunities this afternoon and the following days.  As far as bugs on top the small Olives are your best bet but are definitely spread out and localized in the softer water this time of year.  The good news is the air temps dropping as this front moves in with high temps the next few days being in the 50’s with lows in the 40’s.  Lotsa’ Luck</p>\n",

Tomorrow it looks like some rain moving in and a nice decrease in air temps.  Currently they are saying an inch tomorrow, starting around mid day, which will ensure these higher flows for a while.  Flows currently are exactly where they have been the last week or so with a bit of wading on the upper stretches of both rivers.  The upper West Branch at Stilesville is running 863 cfs and 62 degrees and downriver at Hale Eddy we have 1050 cfs and 56 degrees.  The West Branch still has that “fall stain” to the water but is definitely clear enough for all types of fishing.  The East Branch is running clear with generous releases too.  The upper East at Harvard is now at 805 cfs and 47 degrees and downriver at Fishs’ Eddy the flow is 1430 cfs and 52 degrees.  The main Delaware at Lordville is running 2580 cfs and 58 degrees and is running pretty clear, especially as you move downriver as the water of the two rivers gets a chance to mix.  It has been pretty sunny most of this week which does slow things down a bit but the streamer fishing has been decent, especially early in the day before the sun really comes out.  Nymphing has been pretty good lately and is the most consistent way to get some fish this time of year.  With the recent warm weather we’ve been having there have been pretty consistent Blue Winged Olives in the afternoons along with a few caddis in the #16-18 size range.  With the rain we are getting late tomorrow it could be a good day to be on the water and likely a good streamer day, especially if the rain starts to affect the river.  Lotsa’ Luck</p>\n",

The upper main Delaware at Lordville is running 2870 cfs and 58 degrees.  The fishing has been good for early October but the last few days the wind has been pretty rough and out of the South which makes fishing and rowing difficult at times.  It does look like a Southeast wind still but peaking at 8 mph which isn’t too bad.  The nymphing has been good with small pheasant tails and other small, buggy looking flies.  We are seeing some consistent Blue Winged Olives in the #18-22 range if you come across fish rising in the afternoons.  Small comparaduns, cripples and parachutes are hard to beat and visible flies for the Olives.  If you don’t see much on top there have been a few lingering Isonychia in the #10-12 range and they are always good blind casting flies and a small unweighted dropper is hard to beat.  Streamers are also a good option, especially if in a boat moving down the river.  It looks like similar weather the remainder of the week with some rain and cooler weather moving in this weekend.

This also is why the water at Stilesville is so warm and will last for another month or so.  The fishing has been pretty good for early October with nymphing being the most consistent way to put fish in the boat.

Up at Stilesville the current flow is 1410 cfs and 56 degrees and is currently the lowest water we’ve got on the Delaware system.  The West Branch down here at Hale Eddy we have 1930 cfs and 55 degrees with a decent stain to the water, mostly due to the release water from the reservoir which is typical for the fall.  The upper East Branch at Harvard is running 1500 cfs and 50 degrees and down at Fishs’ Eddy we have 4460 cfs and 55 degrees.  The main Delaware at Lordville the flow is 7630 cfs and 57 degrees.  Conditions for streamers are going to be great for a while with the high water and a short sink tip with a lightweight fly will be perfect for the conditions.  In the afternoons if you get on some rising fish they will likely be on some small BWO’s in the #18-24 range or small ants in the same sizes are hard to beat.  We are getting a few #10-12 Isonychia in the afternoons as well and running a dropper off of them is a great method.  It looks like a nice week coming up with no rain and cooler temps.  Lotsa’ luck</p>\n",

After all of the rain we do have higher water throughout the system with the West Branch running with some stain but is definitely fishable.  The upper East is also quite a bit higher but isn’t totally blown out.  Everything else, like the lower East Branch and main Delaware is going to be high and dirty for at least  a few days.  The upper West Branch at Stilesville is running 1040 cfs and 56 degrees and down at Hale Eddy we have 1820 cfs and 55 degrees.  Considering the rain we got the West here at Hale Eddy faired pretty well some decent visibility this morning which will get better as the day goes on.  The conditions are excellent for streamers and really all types of fishing as long as some bugs show up. The upper East Branch is running 2270 cfs at Harvard and 55 degrees.  Down below the Beaverkill at Fishs’ Eddy we have 12,000 cfs and 55 degrees, which is going to take some time to drop and clear.  The same goes for the main Delaware which is running 19,400 cfs and 60 degrees.  Streamers are going to be hard to beat while covering water today but we should have some BWO’s and a few Isonychia later in day.  Running a dropper off of the Iso wouldn’t be a bad idea, cast tight to the banks in the slower water.  It’s going to be tough wading for a while, even with no more rain in the immediate forecast.

Water levels and clarity haven’t changed much with most of the water in the system being release water.  With the generous releases on both rivers we have relatively high water with very little wading at the moment other than the upper East Branch which does offer some.  The upper East Branch at Stilesville is running 1400 cfs and 55 degrees and down at Hale Eddy we have 1650 cfs and 53 degrees.

We had some pretty good streamer fishing the last couple days  early in the mornings, usually until the sun burns off the fog.  Smaller, sparse streamers on a short sink tip are the perfect tools for the current water.  Depending on where you will be fishing you should see some bugs in the afternoon with BWO’s in the #18-22 range, #10-12 Isonychia and maybe a few Cahills in the #14 range.  If the bugs the fish are feeding on are very hard to see on the water try a winged ant in the #18-24 range, which are hard flies to beat.

It’s definitely on the tough side for wading in most all areas other than the upper East Branch which is very clear and you can navigate around a bit.

The upper main Delaware at Lordville is running 3470 cfs and 58 degrees.  The fishing lately has been pretty good with nymphing with small pheasant tails and other bugs in the #14-18 range under an indicator or dry fly working until you can locate some fish feeding on top.  The bugs haven’t and wont change much for the next few weeks with small BWO’s and winged ants working well if you can find consistently rising fish.  For blind-casting the Isonychia is hard to beat and is a great fly to  support your dropper of choice.

The upper West at Stilesville is now at 1410 cfs and 53 degrees and down at Hale Eddy we have 1700 cfs and 53 degrees.  The whole West is going to have a decent stain for a while due to the fall turnover of the reservoir that typically lasts a few months.  The stain will help the streamer fishing and it’s definitely not going to affect the bugs on top or the fish eating them.  The upper East has dropped to 808 cfs at Harvard and is 48 degrees and very clear, especially compared to the West Branch.  The lower East Branch at Fishs’ Eddy is running 1610 cfs and 56 degrees.

Fishing will be tough on foot at these water levels but if you have access to a boat the fishing has been pretty good for mid-September.  The water level and clarity are perfect for streamers here on the West Branch.  We are also getting some fish rising to the same bugs we’ve had for a while now, mostly small Blue Winged Olives, winged ants and some Isonychia.

With the dropping flows we should see some fish on top with the usual suspects like small Olives in the #18-24 range, #12 Isonychia and small #18-22 winged ants make great flies this time of year.  The nymphing has been good lately, but the higher water the last few days brought a decent amount of algae and debris to get on your subsurface flies.  Streamer fishing could be an option with a bit of stain to the water with lighter weight flies as the water isn’t too deep.  The weather looks great for the weekend with cool temps in the mornings and mild temps during the day.  Lotsa’ Luck</p>\n",

We also have good temps with a bit cooler weather that we woke up to today.  Water clarity is good and yesterday fished pretty well with some fish on top, although this time of year they can be pretty picky to say the least.  The upper West Branch at Stilesville is running 602 cfs and 49 degrees and down at Hale Eddy we have 732 cfs and 52 degrees.  The upper East at Harvard is running 432 cfs and 56 degrees and down at Fishs’ Eddy we have 948 cfs and 62 degrees.  The upper main Delaware at Lordville is running 1900 cfs and 65 cfs.  Yesterday the river down at Lordville peaked at 67 degrees which isn’t bad for late August.  You should be able to find some rising fish in the afternoons and into the evenings.  The bugs which you’ll find them eating lately have been very small Blue Winged Olvies or possibly midges.  Small winged ants in the #20-22 range are also very hard to beat, despite what they may be eating.  Some fish may be eating the nymphs coming up through the water column and small droppers like pheasant tails or soft hackles are hard to beat.  It does look like we will be on the northern edge of the remains of the hurricane moving through the area tomorrow afternoon which should bring light rain to the area starting around 11am for the remainder of the day.  The light rain should be good for the water and Blue Winged Olives and if we get some stain to the water we could have some good streamer opportunities.  Lotsa’ Luck</p>\n",

The upper West Branch at Stilesville is currently running 594 cfs and 50 degrees and down at Hale Eddy we have 761 cfs and 53 degrees.  The upper East Branch at Harvard is running 445 cfs and 57 degrees and downriver at Fishs’ Eddy the flow is 1020 cfs and 62 degrees.  The main Delaware at Lordville is running 2040 cfs and 65 degrees.  With the cloud cover and rain today we hope to have some small Blue Winged Olives in the #18-22 range and a few Isonychia in #12.  When the fish get super picky on the Olives smaller is usually better.  If we get the rain we are forecast to get we could have some decent streamer water.

The upper East Branch at Harvard is at 486 cfs and 56 degrees and downriver at Fishs’ Eddy we have 1170 cfs and 51 degrees.  The upper mainstem at Lordville is running 2370 cfs and 64 degrees.  With the dropping water, great level of clarity (a bit of stain) and cooler temps this should be a great day to be on the water.  With the current conditions you should be able to do whatever type of fishing you like, whether on top or below the surface.  Small #18-20 Blue Winged Olives have been the most important dry flies for the last month or so and that won’t change anytime soon.  Also, a good winged ant pattern in the #18-22 range is likely just as good or better than the small Olives.  There are still some sporadic Isonychia as well and are great while moving in a boat, blind-cast in the faster moving water.  The Isos also make great flies to run a small dropper, like a pheasant tail, off of.  Nymphing has been solid too but yesterday was a bit tough with a good amount of displaced algae from the rain we got late Friday into Saturday.  It does look like some rain for Monday and Wednesday this upcoming week.  Lotsa’ Luck</p>\n",

We got a pretty good thunderstorm last night which dropped a decent amount of rain.  The upper West Branch at Stilesville is running 594 cfs and 49 degrees.  It’s running clear up there but a bit higher due to the increase in release water from the reservoir, likely in anticipation of rain moving in from the South this upcoming week.  Down at Hale Eddy we have 1080 cfs and 55 degrees with what looks like a couple feet of visibility currently but it will clear during the day quite a bit.  Days like this in the recent past have fished pretty well as the water clears.  This week fished pretty well despite the heat with nymphing and some small BWO’s, Isonychia and a small terrestrials on top.  The upper East Branch at Harvard is running 530 cfs and 58 degrees and down at Fishs’ Eddy we have 1990 cfs and 65 degrees.  The main Delaware down at Lordville is running 2860 cfs and 65 degrees.

The upper East Branch at Harvard is running 883 cfs and 58 degrees while down at Fishs’ Eddy we have 2670 cfs and 62 degrees.  The gauge down on the mainstem at Lordville is not working at the moment but it has crested and is dropping.  Today should fish well with a bit of stain to the water which does help.  Streamer fishing will definitely be an option and smaller, sparse lightly weighted flies will be best at these levels.  There are still some #18-20 Sulphurs on the upper stretches of both river and some spinners in the evenings.  Blue Winged Olives in the #18-24 range are going to be the most prevalent bug for a while, even on the sunny days.

The water is fairly turbid now, with low visibility, and should clear nicely as the water drops today.  The upper East at Harvard is now at 1430 cfs and downriver below the Beaverkill the flow is 4800 cfs and 64 degrees at Fishs’ Eddy.  The main Delaware is running 6960 cfs and 65 degrees.

The main Delaware down at Lordville is running 6960 cfs and 65 degrees and is also going to be pretty stained for several days.  The West Branch is going to be the best bet for today with clear and low water up at Stilesville, below the dam, and you’ll have several miles of cleaner water until you get below some of the feeder streams that are pumping in mud.

The rivers have got a little rain, some more than others, but overall the conditions are the same as they’ve been with a bit more water throughout the system and some stain.

We did have a tremendous amount of winged ants on the West Branch yesterday in the #18-22 range and the fishing was as good.  The fish can be pretty selective on the size of these bugs and dealing with a ton of naturals on the water at the same time can be a problem too.  The water is also in pretty good shape to throw some light weight streamers on a floating line which is going to work a lot better in the lower light portions of the day.

The weather looks pretty similar all week with very little chance of rain until the weekend.  Lotsa’ Luck </p>\n",

The upper West Branch at Stilesville is running 602 cfs and 49 degrees while down at Hale Eddy we are looking at 761 cfs and 51 degrees with plenty of visibility.  The upper East at Harvard is now at 440 cfs and 53 degrees and downriver at Fishs’ Eddy we have 866 cfs and 58 degrees.  The main at Lordville is now running 2210 cfs and 50 degrees.  These are awesome flows and temps for the beginning of August.  As for bugs we are still seeing #18-20 Sulphurs, typically starting early afternoon and the flush riding comparaduns, emergers and cripples are hard to beat.  Today looks like a beautiful day to be on the water with guaranteed Blue Winged Olive activity in the #18-24 range.  A few Isonychia are good dries to have as well and are hard to beat when prospecting likely looking water. It looks like good weather this week with no rain in the immediate future.

The upper West Branch has been getting some Sulphur in the #16-20 range, usually starting around noon or so.  Olives and Isonychia are also bugs to look out for and the Iso’s make great blind casting flies in the higher water and support a dropper well.  A small pheasant tail or other small nymphs make great droppers.  Streamer fishing is a good option to fill in the periods without bugs.

The upper West Branch at Stilesville is running 514 cfs and 46 degrees and downriver at Hale Eddy we have 568 and 50 degrees.  The upper East Branch at Harvard is running 277 cfs and 60 degrees and down at Fishs’ Eddy we have 884 cfs and 65 degrees.  The main Delaware down at Lordville is running 1890 cfs and 67 degrees.  The best bet for mid-day bugs is still up around Deposit, with Sulphur typically starting in the early afternoon hours in the #16-20 size range.  Small Olives in the #18-22 range are also around, especially if we do get some clouds/rain later.  Isonychia in the #10-12 range are going to be around for a while and they make great dries to blind cast with or without a dropper - usually a small pheasant tail or something similar.  This week’s forecast looks a lot like last week’s with a decent chance of rain/thunderstorm pretty much every day with fairly warm temps.  Lotsa’ Luck</p>\n",

Here, around 7 miles from the reservoir, the stain is not bad with several feet of visibility and some fish rising already this morning.  The rising fish this morning are likely trash-feeding, eating whatever ended up in the river after the storm.  The bugs we are seeing will be the #16-20 Sulphurs, #18-22 Blue Winged Olives, #10-12 Isonychia and a few summer Cahills in #14 and the spinners of the above bugs.  We should have some good streamer water for at least today, especially as you move downriver and around any feeder stream.

We’re also seeing some Isonychia in the 10-12 range and a few Lt Cahills in the 14 range.  Streamers aren’t a bad option early in the morning or if we get any significant rain in the future which gives the river a bit of stain.

If you’ve fished the summer Sulphurs you know how tricky the fish get, eating a lot of cripples and bugs subsurface, while letting a lot of duns pass over them.  Droppers like small, unweighted nymphs and soft hackles work very well.  Also, ants and beetles are great flies to try on these fussy fish.  Isonychia are also around in the #10-12 range and will be here for a while as well.  Nymphing is going to be a good option before the bugs get going later today.

It looks like clear skies today with some rain moving in tomorrow morning.  The West Branch is running a bit higher today due to a slight increase in the release from Cannonsville reservoir, bringing Stilesville to 594 cfs and 45 degrees.  Downriver at Hale Eddy the flow is 738 cfs and 50 degrees, great conditions for both the wading and floating angler.  The upper East at Harvard is running 229 cfs and 59 degrees while down at Fishs’ Eddy the flow is 616 cfs and 65 degrees.  The main Delaware is running 1630 cfs and 67 degrees.  If you choose to fish the main or East Branch you need to check the water temps as they’re getting too high pretty quickly in the day.  For bugs we are still seeing the #14-16 Sulphurs, a few #12-14 March Browns, a few #10-12 Isonychia and when it clouds up BWO’s are always around.  With  the conditions, nymphing is likely going to be the best bet mid-day or throwing a bigger bug with a small dropper in the faster water.  It looks like some decent rain during the day tomorrow which is the best case scenario with chances of rain most days this upcoming week.  Lotsa’ Luck</p>\n",

The main at Lordville is running 1820 cfs and 65 degrees.  The warm and sunny weather tends to require some subsurface fishing during the mid-day hours with small pheasant tails, sulphur nymphs and many other generic patterns.  There have been some bugs in the afternoons/evenings with #14-16 Sulphurs, #18-22 BWO’s, #10-14 March Browns and some Green Drakes on the main and East.

The upper main Delaware at Lordville is running 2160 cfs and 61 degrees.  With the warmer air temps and high sun the West Branch and upper East are going to be safe bets durning the day with some fish feeding in the mornings, typically just trash-feeding on leftover spinners and caddis from the previous day’s activity.  Later in the day we are seeing some #14-16 Sulphurs, #18-22 BWO’s, #10-14 March Browns/Grey Fox and several types of caddis in the #16-18 range.  Spent caddis are great flies this time of year too.  The main Delaware and East had been getting some big bugs earlier this week, as well as the above ones, so if you check water temps and they’re still good you could have some good spinners at the end of the day.

The rivers have dropped a lot over the last 24-36 hours due to the reservoirs ending their spilling and the release decreased as well.  The upper West Branch at Stilesville is running 1230 cfs and 50 degrees while down at Hale Eddy we are looking at 1620 cfs and 45 degrees and running very clear.  The upper East Branch at Harvard is running 598 cfs and 46 degrees and down at Fishs’ Eddy we have 1430 cfs and 49 degrees.  The main Delaware down at Lordville is running 3650 cfs and 48 degrees.  Yesterday fished very well throughout the system as the water was dropping, which is usually the case.  There were great bugs with Hendricksons, Blue Quills, Olives, March Browns and lots of caddis.  Rusty spinners fell in the evening with the warmer weather and tonight should be no different. Throwing streamers is still an option in the higher water but everything is running very clear and once the sun really comes out the streamer fishing becomes much more difficult.  Lotsa’ Luck.  </p>\n",

With days now without significant rain all rivers are running very clear.  The upper East Branch at Harvard dropped to a nice level of 679 cfs and 45 degrees, now the best wading option on the Delaware system.  Downriver at Fishs’ Eddy we are looking at 1600 cfs and 48 degrees.  The  main Delaware at Lordville is running 4570 cfsa and 47 degrees.    It looks like minimal wind today, under 10 mph which is great, with warm temps till dark which will be great for spinners.  We’ve been seeing the same bugs for a while now and for mayflies we still have Hendricksons, some Blue Quills, maybe BWO’s, March Browns and several caddis flies.

The rivers are still slowly dropping throughout the system with clear and wadeable water on all rivers.

The upper East Branch at Harvard is running 213 cfs and 44 degrees and down on the lower East at Fishs’ Eddy we have 685 cfs and 45 degrees.  The upper main Delaware is running 1550 cfs and 46 degrees at Lordville.  Yesterday was similar weather and we had pretty good fishing with some decent bugs coming off.  The #16-18 Blue Quills and #14-16 Hendricksons have been the main mayflies to have in your box as well as the usual small Olives which are always good flies to have.  We are also seeing some #18-20 Chimarra caddis in pretty good numbers and a small spent caddis pattern is nice to have on picky fish.  The nymphing has been good before the bugs get going, typically around noon, depending on the air temps.  It does look like we are getting some rain starting later tonight and into the morning of tomorrow and we’ll happily take all we can get.  Lotsa’ Luck</p>\n",

With a little snow on the ground we should get a little runoff throughout the day which won’t hurt as the rivers are still slowly dropping and all remain very clear.

The upper East Branch at Harvard is running 229 cfs and 40 degrees and down below the Beaverkill at Fishs’ Eddy we are looking at 744 cfs and 40 degrees.  The upper main Delaware at Lordville is running 1670 cfs and 41 degrees.  Despite the nasty weather the last couple days we did have some bugs and everyone who put in effort did catch fish.  With the weather getting a little more back to normal we should expect some good fishing the next few days.  The bugs to expect are small #18-22 Blue Winged Olives, #16-18 Blue Quills and #14-16 Hendricksons.  Nymphing has been productive too with the lower water, especially earlier in the day before the surface activity starts.  Small pheasant tails are hard to beat along with heavier stoneflies if you need to get down deeper.  All of the above bugs will turn into rusty spinners in the appropriate sizes and are hard to beat this time of year, even during a hatch.  It looks like temps around 60 the next few days with the weather warming up at the beginning of next week.  Lotsa’ Luck</p>\n",

We are still seeing a few different bugs and the fish have been looking up.  For the mayflies you’ll likely encounter some #18-22 BWO’s, #16-18 Blue Quills and #14-16 Hendricksons (mostly main and East).  All of these bugs are going to turn into a rusty spinner of the appropriate size, so those are great dries to have as well, and can really be fished all afternoon / evening and are a hard fly to beat this time of year.  We are also seeing a few dark stoneflies #16-20 and Chimarra Caddis in #18-20.

The last 10 days or so the fish have been looking up and we’ve  had some really good fishing this past week and should have a good week ahead of us with some more #16-18 Blue Quills and #14-16 Hendricksons becoming go-to bugs.  With the rainy weather last week the small #18-22 Blue Winged Olives were really strong and it does look some rain mid week coming up.

This week fished very well despite the cooler air and water temps, mainly due to the crumby/rainy weather which always fishes better than bright sun despite the air temp.  We are seeing lots of little Olives in the #18-22 range and the fish were readily taking duns and emergers if presented properly.  We are seeing some small caddis as well and the Hendricksons should really pick up over the next week and will be a key bug to have for a few weeks in the #14-16 size as well.  We should start seeing more Paraleps/Blue Quills in the #16-18 range which will also be a staple the next couple weeks.

There have been some small Chimarra Caddis #18-20 and a few Hendricksons downriver and on the East as well.  Nymphing and throwing lightweight streamers is a good option early in the day before the bugs get going.

This week looks like it could be a good one with the daily cloud cover and chance of rain all week.  The water is in good shape for nymphing with small stoneflies and pheasant tails working well.  The streamer fishing can also be good this time of year with smaller, lighter flies working well in the lower water and is always a method to cover water.  We’ve been seeing more bug life by the day and weeks as water temps warm. Most of your bugs are coming off in the afternoon hours when the water warms up a bit.  We are still seeing decent numbers of stoneflies in the #14-20 range and an elk hair caddis dry in with a dark body is always a good fly this time of year.  There are also some small #18-20 Chimarra caddis too.  We’ve been getting a few BWO’s in the #20-24 range, especially on these cloudy days.  There have been some reports of bigger bugs like Hendricksons in the #14-16 range, mostly on the East Branch which has been a bit warmer than the West for the last week or two.

With the lower water the nymphing is going to be more productive and the good runs will be more obvious.  Small black stoneflies in the #14-20 range, Copper Johns and pheasant tails are good flies this time of year.

The upper East Branch at Harvard is running 99 cfs and 51 degrees while down at Fishs’ Eddy we are looking at 216 cfs and 56 degrees.  The upper mainstem at Lordville is running 898 cfs and 56 degrees.  The West Branch is still flowing with some stain from the release so the streamer fishing should remain solid.  We are still seeing some decent Blue Winged Olives in the afternoons in sizes #18-24 as well as their small Rusty Spinners.  Small pheasant tails in the same sizes are working well too until some bugs show up in the afternoons.  The weekend forecast looks like mild temps, around 60 with no rain in the forecast.

The upper East remains pretty low with 98 cfs up at Harvard and 52 degrees.  Downriver at Fishs’ Eddy we are looking at 228 cfs and 53 degrees.  The main Delaware down at Lordville is running 1380 cfs and 53 degrees.  They should keep this release up until we get significant rains to meet the downstream water levels needed for minimum flows.  With the stained water of the West and the time of year we should have some good streamer fishing for a while.  At these levels the West is going to be on the high side for wading but is possible for strong waders who know where to go, tailouts are always good places to start at these water levels.  We could have some Blue Winged Olives later today with the weather and the main Delaware is at a great level now and the water is going to be quite a bit clearer than on the West as the sediment drops as you move downriver.

The flows have continued to drop a bit as they are getting rain downriver and won’t need to release from Cannonsville to meet the minimum.  For the foreseeable future we will relying on rain to bring the river up any from the current flow of 160 cfs at Stilesville.

The bugs to pack for the day are pretty simple with small Olives in the #20-24 range and some Rusty Spinners of the same size.  You could see an Isonychia or two and they still work well when blind-cast through the riffles with or without a dropper.

With the anticipation of the rain coming they have cut back the release from Cannonsville reservoir onto the West Branch. A lot of people express frustration due to the changing water levels lately but it is very predictable, if they can meet the minimum flow downriver at Montegue, NJ, they will cut it back to around 150 cfs at Stilesville according to the current flow plan.

The upper East at Harvard is running 108 cfs and 49 degrees while down at Fishs’ Eddy we have 268 cfs and 51 degrees.  The main Delaware is running at 1160 cfs and 52 degrees, which is a great level for down there.  The anglers that fished yesterday moved a lot of fish on streamers as the West is in great shape for throwing streamers.  This time of year, with the spawning fish, you do get a lot of swipes and short-strikes but they aren’t really missing the fly.  Some days they’re swiping, others they’re eating.  Smaller, sparse flies also work very well as far as getting fish to eat.  We have been seeing some decent Blue Winged Olives in the afternoon hours, say from 2-3pm on, in sizes #18-22 as well as their small rusty spinners.  It looks like rain coming in Sunday night for a couple days, not a significant amount of rain so it should definitely help the fishing but be prepared for them to lower the release if the downstream flows are met with natural rain.

The flow up at Stilesville is running at 680 cfs and 50 degrees while down at Hale Eddy we are looking at 806 cfs and 49 degrees.  The river does have a pretty good stain to it on the West which does clear slightly as you go down river.

The main Delaware down at Lordville is running 1290 cfs and 51 degrees.  The flow downriver at Montegue is currently 1500, which is still on the low side, so we should definitely see the increased flow on the West sustained through the weekend.

They are planning to reduce the release from Cannonsville reservoir today from 150 cfs to 45 cfs for a few hours and hope to have it back up to 150 cfs by noon today.  They have increased the release on the East Branch to help the mainstem with the reduced flow from the West.  Tomorrow, they are planning on reducing the flow to 0 cfs from Cannonsville for most of the day.  If you are in the area or planning a trip we would advise to fish the East Branch or main Delaware until we see what goes on with the West Branch.

Small Olives in the #18 - #24 range as well as small Rusty spinners in those sizes are hard flies to beat for the afternoon / evenings.  Blind casting some larger Isonychia or other attractor patterns works if you cover water and get good drifts.  The nymphing  has been pretty decent with small pheasant tails and caddis pupa.

We’ve been getting some small Olives in the #18-24 range and are typically better when we get some cloud cover or better yet, rain.  There are still some Isonychia around in size #10-12 which are the blind-casting fly of choice this time of year.  There are also a feww #14-16 Cahills around too.  Droppers off of the bigger flies are also good producers when covering the riffles.  Streamer fishing is best early in the morning, say from daybreak until the sun really comes out.  In the bright sun and lower water it definitely gets tougher.  Lotsa’ Luck</p>\n",

The upper West Branch at Stilesville is running 383 cfs and 47 degrees while down at Hale Eddy we are looking at 516 cfs and 48 degrees with a bit of stain to the release water which is minimal and typical this time of year.

Today is going to be sunny so some nymphing will likely be a good bet mid-day with some Blue Winged Olives in the afternoon hours, during the warmest part of the day.  Be on the lookout for their small rusty spinners which are great bugs this time of year.  A few Isonychia and Cahills are also typically around in the afternoons too in sparse numbers.  Be on the lookout for the winged ants which are typically #18-24 and can be tough to tell apart from small Olives unless you catch some.  Streamers are always a good bet this time of year, especially in the mornings.  Lotsa’ Luck</p>\n",

The main Delaware is running 991 cfs and 61 degrees to start the day.  Today looks like we could have some small BWO’s with the cloud cover, typically in #18-22, and the Isonychia in #10-12 are good bugs to have to cover some water with.  The Isos also make good flies to run a dropper off of and run through some riffles if not much is happening on top.  We are seeing some winged ants in size #18-24, which are usually a little more common on the lower half of the West Branch.  There have been some of the larger October Caddis in size #10 which might not get taken off the surface too often but make good subsurface flies with the pupa.  Streamer fishing can be great this time of year in low-light situations, especially the mornings.  Lotsa’ Luck</p>\n",

For bugs we aren’t going to see much changing for the foreseeable future with small BWO’s, #10-12 Isonychia  and terrestrials.  Running a dropper off of the Isonychia is a good move, especially in the riffles with a small pheasant tail or something similar.  Overall, the water is pretty clear so streamer fishing can be tough unless you’re fishing at daybreak or another low light situation.

The main Delaware at Lordville is running 1150 cfs and 64 degrees to start the day and we will have to watch the temps on the main which are likely to get too warm later this afternoon.  We are still getting some Olives throughout the system which is the main bug unless you are blind casting some Isonychia which are still around but it’s not like there is a big hatch of them, just a few throughout the day.  The same goes for the Light Cahills.  There have been some Tricos in the #20-24 range on the lower West, East Branch and upper main in the mornings and if the conditions are right you’ll hit the spinner fall during the mid-morning hours.  Early morning streamer fishing is a good bet if you’re and early riser but once the sun really comes out it is generally a waste of time.  And as is typical of the West, small and sparse streamers will work much better than the big articulated streamers that will move some fish and get some looks but you won’t have near the success you would on smaller flies.

As far as bugs we are looking at some #18-24 Blue Winged Olives, #10-12 Isonychia and a few #14-16 Cahills.  Nymphing has been pretty good as well when there’s nothing on top with pheasant tails, caddis pupa and any other favorites you might have.  The streamer fishing can be a great opportunity to get on some larger fish whenever you have some low-light conditions like early mornings or around sunset till dark.  As we move into fall it can be a great time to throw some streamers with the right conditions as the browns get more aggressive and start to move upriver to spawn.  Lotsa’ Luck</p>\n",

The upper West Branch at Stilesville is running 550 cfs and 47 degrees.  Downriver at Hale Eddy we are looking at 656 cfs adn 51 degrees with good clarity throughout the river.  The upper East at Harvard is running 266 cfs and 55 degrees and downriver at Fishs’ Eddy we have 670 cfs and 64 degrees.  The main Delaware down at Lordville is running 1440 cfs and 66 degrees.  It looks like good weather all week with cooler temps in the 70’s and some off and on cloud cover.  With the warm summer we’ve been having the cooler weather should help the lower half of the West and East Branch.  With the cooler water temps there’s a better chance of some daytime bug activity on these sections versus right at dark or in the middle of the night.  We are still seeing a few Sulphurs up around Deposit but that hatch is winding up as usual this time of year.  Blue Winged Olives will are always good bugs to have and become more important as we move towards fall.  Isonychia are also gonna be around for another month or more.  Streamer fishing, especially early or in low light situations, can be very productive too.  There are a few Tricos on the lower West or over on the East Branch too.  They can be spotty but are usually around most mornings this time of year.  Lotsa’ Luck.  </p>\n",

For any mid-day bug activity you need to focus on the upper West Branch around Deposit where we are still getting a few Sulphurs in the early afternoon.  Blue Winged Olives are also good to have and it looks like the next two days we will have better cloud cover and some possible light rain on Monday.  The mornings are a good time to hit the water this time of year and streamers are hard to be in the hours shortly after daybreak.

The upper river around Deposit was the first to clear and has fished pretty well the last couple days with some Sulphurs in the #18-20 range starting to show up around noon.  We should still have some decent activity on streamers since there is a slight stain to the water plus the increased flow.  Isonychia are still around and make good blind casting flies as well as small Olives in the #18-22 range.  Ants and beetles are good bugs to have this time of year as well and can be used any time of the day.  Lotsa’ Luck</p>\n",

We are still seeing the tail end of the small #18-20 Sulphurs and their spinners in the evenings.  There have also been some #10-12 Isonychia and #14 Cahills throughout the West Branch and also make good blind-casting flies during the day.  Terrestrials, like ants and beetles work well too this time of year, even during a good Sulphur hatch.  Mornings can also be a good time to get out without much competition on the water and is by far the best time to throw some streamers, usually from daybreak till 7 am or so.  Lotsa’ Luck</p>\n",

Today should be  pretty similar to what we’ve been seeing with some #18-20 Sulphurs showing up in the early afternoon up around Deposit.  Sparse emergers, cripples and oftentimes droppers are good flies to use during this hatch as the fish have seen these same bugs for over a month now and are picky to say the least.  There are some Isonychia around as well and they always make good blind-casting flies and are great for running droppers from.  Blue Winged Olives are good to have around this time of year as well.

It’s difficult fishing and they will test your patience for sure, so having several patterns and droppers with help your odds.  The nymphing has been good too and the lower half of the West has a lot less algae than the upper river does.  With the Isonychia around too blind casting or swinging larger wets in the faster water will produce fish if you put some time in.

Nymphing with small pheasant tails and Sulphur specific nymphs will produce although there is a decent amount of algae upriver but down on the lower half of the West Branch it does get better.  Temps today will peak in the low-80’s and then get a little warmer the next couple days.  Lotsa’ Luck</p>\n",

The main Delaware at Lordville is running 1750 cfs and 70 degrees.  The cloud cover will be nice compared to the high sun and 90-degree temps we had most of last week and the highs this week look to be in the low-80’s without much rain.  With the cloud cover we could have some Olives today and always bring a few in #18-22 as well as the #18-20 Sulphurs which have been starting in the early afternoon up around Deposit.  Mornings, this time of year, can be a good time to be out  with streamer, nymphs and oftentimes some fish trash-feeding on leftover spinners or terrestrials.  Lotsa’ Luck</p>\n",

The early afternoon Sulphurs up around Deposit are still the main hatch and will be the rest of the month and into August.

We have been seeing pretty good Sulphurs in the #18-20 range from Stilesville and through the no-kill section below Deposit starting around noon.  Droppers and emergers are the key during this tough hatch as well as long leaders and drag-free drifts.  We are seeing the usual #10-12 Isonychia and #14 Cahills as well throughout the whole West Branch, typically in the afternoons/evenings too.  Ants and beetles are always great flies this time of year, especially on the picky fish, even during a good Sulphur hatch.  It looks like the rain tonight will drop over an inch into tomorrow and the more the merrier as we’ve got no significant rain in over a month.

We won’t have a change in bugs for a while, which is ok, as we starting to get pretty good numbers of the small Sulphurs #18-20 up around the Deposit area from around noon on.  This is a notoriously tough hatch and many of the fish feeding are doing so right below the surface of the water and various droppers, like small pheasant tails or soft hackles, work very well.  Don’t forget the terrestrials too, even durning a good Sulphur hatch.  Blind casting Isonychia in the riffles is also a good tactic for the next few months.

The West Branch is going to be  the only game in town for the foreseeable future until we get much cooler air temps.  The extra water in the West doesn’t hurt and mid-700’s is a good level for boaters and waders as well.  Not much is going to change on the bugs either for a while with the mid-day Sulphurs up around Deposit being the most significant hatch for a few months, typically starting around noon.  We are getting spinners too around dark with some other bugs mixed in randomly throughout the day.  Having  a few Isonychia or Cahills is always good and are nice sized flies to run droppers or blind cast in the faster water.

The West is in good shape today and last night the East Branch and Beaverkill still had a pretty good stain to them but are dropping and clearing quickly.  The upper West Branch at Stilesville is running 582 cfs this morning and 47 degrees while down at Hale Eddy we are looking at 676 cfs and 50 degrees with only a bit of color from Thursday morning’s rains.  The upper East Branch at Harvard is running 281 cfs and 60 degrees while down at Fishs’ Eddy we are looking at 1560 cfs and 64 degrees, after the Beaverkill’s 900 cfs pumping in.  With the recent rain and water temps most of the fishing has been on the West with the same bugs still happening.  Look for #16 Sulphurs, a few #14 Grey Fox and Spent caddis in the 16-20 range throughout the day with most of the surface activity happening in the latter half of the day.  There are still some drakes but fishing downriver or the East hasn’t been ideal with the recent water temps and clarity over the last 24 hours. We should get some decent spinners tonight as it looks to be clear with cooler temps ahead.  Lotsa’ Luck</p>\n",

The upper Main Delaware at Lordville is running 1360 cfs and 64 degrees.  The bugs to be prepared for are still some small #16-20 caddis, with some tan, some darker wing and body and a few Apple caddis on the upper West Branch.  Spent caddis are always good options for tough fish or when they are kind of trash feeding without a notable hatch going on.  Sulphurs in the 14-16 range and their spinners.  Small BWO’s and their spinners are always good to have.  There are a few March Browns in the 10-12 range as well and they make good prospecting flies when you want to cover some water.  It looks like the temps over night are gonna be a bit cooler, in the upper-40’s to 50’s, which will help keep the temps down a bit on the main and East with pretty dry weather all week.

Spent caddis and small rusty spinners are hard to beat for mid-day dries.  The nymphing has been pretty consistent too with the lower water with Pheasant Tails, Hare’s Ear’s and March Brown nymphs.

We are still seeing good bugs, the same ones we’ve had for a few weeks now, and last night was pretty good for all who were on the water.

As we are approaching spring here in a few days it actually feels like spring for a change with warmer temps and not much snow this winter.  Water levels are currently looking good with some decent wading on the West Branch and on the warmer days we are getting water temps into the mid-40’s.  For those looking to get away from the house and get some fresh air there are some good opportunities currently with some bugs starting to show up as well.  The West Branch up at Stilesville is running 584 cfs and 38 degrees even though the upper West is still closed down to the PA border until April 1st.  The West Branch down at Hale Eddy is running 853 cfs and 38 degrees as well and will likely peak in the low-40’s later today.  The water throughout the system is currently very clear. The upper East Branch is running 507 at Harvard and 39 degrees and down at Fishs’ Eddy we are looking at 1580 cfs and 40 degrees.  The main Delaware down at Lordville is running 2780 cfs and 39 degrees today.  Fishing so far has primarily been nymphing with small Black Stoneflies in #16-20, Copper Johns of the same size and Pheasant Tails are always good go-to’s as well.  As far as bugs you’ll see on top look for the Black Stones in #16-20 as well and the afternoons/evenings are often the best and warmest times if fish are going to come to the surface.  A small, dark Elk Hair Caddis in the appropriate size are great flies to represent the stones when they’re on the water as the naturals wings will be splayed out due to them being dead or fluttering.  Another good method, especially from the boat, is streamer fishing and this time of year it’s going to be low and slow as far as the movement of the fly due to the cold water temps.  Fishing with unweighted or lightly-weighted flies helps, allowing you to fish the fly slowly without hanging up on the bottom.  The fly shop is currently open every day to walk-in traffic and we’re here to answer phone calls and make reservations.  We are being very cautious with the virus going around, focusing on maintaining a sanitary environment here at the shop.  If anything changes in regard to the office being open for walk-in traffic we will let you know here and via social media.  Stay safe and we look forward to seeing everyone here this season. </p>\n",

With the recent temps in the mid-40’s to mid-60’s during the day the fishing has been decent to pretty good at times, especially after the rains we had late this week that really helped the freestone rivers and caused a decreased release from Cannonsville that really cleared up the water on the West - and mainstem too.  The current flow at Stilesville is running 188 cfs and 55 degrees and down at Hale Eddy we’ve got 473 cfs and 50 degrees with clear water throughout the river, much better than it’s been the last two months.

The upper East at Harvard is running 331 cfs and 46 degrees while down at Fishs’ Eddy we have 1680 cfs and 48 degrees.  Lordville down on the mainstem is running 2090 cfs and 48 degrees this morning.  With the lower, clearer water the last couple days we have had some decent fishing with streamers working well, especially mornings and evenings.

They’ve cut the release back from Cannonsville into the West again overnight, foreseeing the rain we are supposed to get tomorrow and Thursday which looks like several inches once all is said and done.  The current flow on the upper West at Stilesville is 299 cfs and 58 degrees and downriver at Hale Eddy we have 490 cfs and 55 degrees.  The upper East Branch at Harvard is running 105 cfs and 51 degrees and down at Fishs’ Eddy we are looking at 251 cfs and 52 degrees.  The mainstem down at Lordville is currently running 898 cfs and 55 degrees.  With today being the last day to fish the upper West, from the PA border up to the dam, we do have very wadeable conditions throughout the river and we should have a few bugs this afternoon.  When the water was at a similar level last week we did have some fish rising in the afternoons with BWO’s and caddis and the nymphing was also pretty good.  We still have that fall stain to the water we’ve been getting since early September but it doesn’t affect the fishing much and actually helps the streamer bite a bit especially with lower light in morning and evening.  The East is a very clear but low and there’s been some decent bugs and some fish rising in the afternoons as well.  The main is going to be very wadeable at these levels as well with clearer water than the West that does continue to clear as you go downriver.  Lotsa’ Luck </p>\n",

The upper East Branch at Harvard is running 108 cfs and 51 degrees while down at Fishs’ Eddy we have 262 cfs and 52 degrees.  The main Delaware is running 1150 cfs and 55 degrees.  The West is still pretty stained and the East is still low and very clear.  The main is a good place to get some easy wading in and a bit clearer water.  We have still been getting some Blue Winged Olives, Caddis and a few Isonychia in the afternoons on all the rivers.  It looks like we will get around an inch of rain on Wednesday and some light rain most of the day on Thursday which will more than likely cause them to cut the water release back on the West and give us a bit more wading opportunity.  Remember, tomorrow the 15th will be the last day to fish the West Branch from the PA border up to the dam until next April.  The rest of the water downriver is open year round to catch and release.

The upper East Branch at Harvard is running 120 cfs and 50 degrees while down at Fishs’ Eddy we have 336 cfs and 52 degrees - up a bit from the Beaverkill after the rains on Monday.  The main Delaware at Lordville is currenlty running 1180 cfs and 55 degrees.  The West Branch is still running with some stain to the water coming out of the reservoir but it does look better with the lower water and is highly wadeable wherever you may go.  Nymphing and streamer fishing have been pretty good lately and typically some Blue Winged Olives, Isonychia and small #16-18 Dark Caddis in the afternoons into the evening and a few fish looking up.  The East also is fishing pretty well even though it’s fairly low and very clear.  The upper mainstem is very wadeable too with the same bugs and is clearer than the West once you get below the confluence and does clear more as you travel down river.  The weather this weekend into next week are cooling a bit with mid-30’s at night and 50’s-60’s for the high, without much rain but it does look like good cloud cover this Saturday.

They have cut the release from Cannonsville back quite a bit and the flow up at Stilesville is currently 221 cfs and 58 degrees while down at Hale Eddy we have 621 cfs and 56 degrees.  The East Branch did bump up a bit but is very fishable with 219 cfs up at Harvard and 767 cfs and 55 degrees down at Fishs’ Eddy.  The main Delaware at Lordville is running 1270 cfs and 56 degrees.  We’ll have to see how long they keep the flow down on the West Branch because downriver at Montegue, NJ the flow is very low, around 1,400 cfs which is well below the minimum they try to meet.  It wouldn’t be surprising if they started to raise the release on the West soon.  They are calling for clouds today so we could see some Olives in the afternoon hours.  With the lower water the nymphing should be good as well.  Although the water is lower it’s still fairly stained so the streamer fishing should remain a good option.  Lotsa’ Luck</p>\n",

We really do need the water as we haven’t had a significant rain in a long time.  They’ve, as expected, kept tapering off the release from Cannonsville to start to conserve some water in the reservoir.  Temps the next few days seem pretty mild, in the mid-60’s, with no more rain this week once this storm passes.  The upper West Branch at Stilesville is running 296 cfs and 59 degrees this morning and down at Hale Eddy we have 503 cfs and 58 degrees.

The main Delaware at Lordville is currently running 818 cfs and 56 degrees.  At the current water levels all sections of the system are going to be very wadeable.  The West Branch is still running pretty stained from the release and we can expect some more color to show up as the rain starts to raise the feeder creeks which flow into the river.  We should have some good streamer fishing if you get out today.  If the rain isn’t too heavy we could have some surface activity in the afternoon hours with small, #18-22 Blue Winged Olives and maybe a few #12 Isonychia here and there.

Flows are still pretty consistent with 719 cfs up at Stilesville and 53 degrees.  The West Branch down at Hale Eddy is running 847 cfs and 52 degrees and the whole West is pretty dirty from the release water with about 3 ft of visibility which does clear some as you move downriver.  The East Branch at Harvard is running 137 cfs and 52 degrees and down at Fishs’ Eddy we are looking at 146 cfs and 57 degrees.  Lordville on the main Delaware is running 991 cfs and 58 degrees.  The morning streamer fishing has been pretty good on the West with the stained water and is not too bad during the day which would be better if we didn’t have the high sun all day.  Nymphing has been a good option during the day on all of the branches.  There have been some bugs later in the day with some Olives in the #18-22 range, a few Isonychia in size #12 and on the main a few #12 White Fly spinners down on the main.  The weekend looks to be a sunny one with warmer weather in the upper-70’s.  Lotsa’ Luck</p>\n",

Water levels are holding pretty steady with a little more water overnight from Cannonsville into the West due to the lack of recent rain and low water flows downriver.  Stilesville is currently running 771 cfs and 53 degrees on the upper West and down at Hale Eddy we have 965 cfs and 52 degrees with several feet of visibility due to the stained release.  The upper East Branch is running much lower and clear and does offer some good wading opportunities if the West Branch is too high for your liking.  The upper East at Harvard is running 153 cfs nd 52 degrees while down at Fishs’ Eddy we have 178 cfs and 60 degrees.  The main Delaware is running at a nice level with good wading and is clearer as you go downriver and some of the silt mixes and drops out.  The flow down at Lordville is currently running 1050 cfs and 60 degrees.  Fishing has been pretty good lately, especially if we can get some cloud cover, with some decent surface activity starting in the afternoon hours.  The Blue Winged Olives in #18-22 have been the most consistent bug lately as well as a few #12 Isonychia which are great blind-casting bugs or good to run a dropper off of if you prefer.  The main has been getting some #12 White Fly spinners in the nice evenings too.  Nymphing has been pretty good with Iso nymphs and pheasant tails working well.  The cloudy water is also a good time to throw some streamers if nothing is happening on top.  If on foot throwing streamers keep moving to cover water as much as possible.  The weather looks pretty similar all week with temps warming up this weekend.  Lotsa’ Luck</p>\n",

We should have some good Blue Winged Olives in #18-22 in the afternoon hours with some possible spinners later.  A few Isonychia are always around and are great flies for the random risers or to blind cast with.  The main has been getting some decent white flies and spinners in the evenings too.

The weather yesterday was cloudy all day and the fishing was pretty good with some good Olives most of the afternoon.  The upper main is in good shape and is a nice medium due to the higher West Branch and lower East and clears up as you get below the junction.  There are still a few Isonychia around and there have been some large, #8 October caddis around the last few weeks.

At these levels tails of pools and wider sections of river are going to be the most wadeable and there’s lots of water to fish at these levels on the West.

The water is still has the same stain as we’ve had for the last few weeks but it may appear dirtier just due to the volume of water in the river now but it’s definitely clear enough for all types of fishing and should really help with the streamer bite.  The upper East Branch at Harvard is running 167 cfs and 52 degrees while down at Fishs’ Eddy we are looking at 199 cfs and 59 degrees.   The mainstem down at Lordville is running 818 cfs and 60 degrees this morning and the extra water we’ve got hasn’t made its way down there yet, at least according to the gauge which isn’t real time.  With the cooler temps everything is currently fishable and the upper main has been a good spot to be lately as the fish haven’t had too much pressure lately.  We are still seeing the same bugs throughout the system on the different branches with a typical Olive hatch in the afternoons/evenings.  We are also seeing the Isonychia in #12 and some hebes in the #16-18 range along with the spinners on most evenings, typically the last few hours before dark.  We are seeing a few of the winged ants in size #18-26 which are always good fall flies and the fish will definitely target them.  With the increased water and stain we’ve got on the West Branch we should have some good streamer fishing coming up and the fall is an excellent time with the browns starting to think about the upcoming spawn which usually means more aggressive fish.

They were calling for over an inch with rain most of the day but it does look like the rain will pass soon, within the hour, with maybe a bit later today but nowhere near an inch.  The flows are actually down slightly due to the decrease in the release from Cannonsville into the West Branch over the last couple days, likely in anticipation of this storm which will help meet downstream flows that are getting pretty low.

It would be highly unlikely that today wouldn’t be very good day throwing streamers as we haven’t had much change to the 500-700 cfs flow in several months and no decently stained water either.

The last few clear nights have had some great spinner falls as well.  The lower West and the upper mainstem are really benefitting from the cooler temps and are turning back on as they usually do.  The main is a great place to get back to and fish to some fish that haven’t been harassed too much the last several months and it should be a great fall down there.

The next few days look great temperature-wise with cool morning temps around 50 and highs in the lower-70’s.  The weather through the weekend looks like it’s going to be pretty sunny with no rain in the immediate forecast.  Water temps are looking good and will only get better downriver with these cool nights coming up.  The upper West at Stilesville is running 646 cfs and 50 degrees, up a bit due to the increase in release from Cannonsville which started early this morning.  The West down at Hale Eddy is currently running 664 cfs and 52 degrees and will rise a bit more as the extra water makes its way downriver.  The upper East Branch at Harvard is running 191 cfs and 56 this morning and down at Fishs’ Eddy we are looking at 336 cfs and 66 degrees.  The mainstem at Lordville is running 1080 cfs and 66 degrees.  You can still find a few #18 Sulphurs upriver as the hatch is winding down for the year, usually mixed with some Olives and the occasional Cahill and Isonychia.  You’ll see the same bugs downriver as well with a few less Sulphurs, especially mid-day, but blind casting those larger Isos has been working.  The dropper off of the Iso, say an unweighted pheasant tail or Iso nymph, has been working well when fished in likely holding water and riffs.  The winged-ants are just getting going and is typically a great hatch once the fish really get keyed in on them which can take a few days of them being on the water.  Enjoy the great weather this weekend.  Lotsa’ Luck</p>\n",

      "</h1><p class=\"\" style=\"white-space:pre-wrap;\">Today is looking to be a sunny one with a few clouds later and temps in the mid-80’s.  Water levels have dropped consistently on the rivers which were puffed up yesterday due to the rain Sunday night.  The upper West Branch at Stilesville is running 510 cfs and 51 degrees while down at Hale Eddy we have 687 cfs and 54 degrees.  The East Branch upriver at Harvard is running 194 cfs and 60 degrees and down at Fishs’ Eddy we have 340 cfs and 71 degrees.  The main Delaware at Lordville is running 1140 cfs and 73 degrees.  With the sunny skies today the fishing on top is going to be tough and we can hope for a few bugs and cooperative fish.  The Sulphur hatch on the upper river is slowing down and although you can find some bugs there in the afternoon the fish eating them have been pretty small lately with the majority of larger fish waiting till later to show their faces.  Pretty typical this time of year and as we start to get some cooler temps later this month the lower West, and eventually the upper main, begins to look better and better.  The pressure the fish have received over the last few months is much less downriver versus the no-kill area.  You’ll still see the same bugs, Olives, Isonychia and Cahills with a few Sulphurs on the lower river, just not a great mid-day hatch.  Blind casting the riffs with Isos or running a dropper underneath a big fly has been producing fish lately.  Nymphing can also be very good during the middle of the day.  It looks like we are in for some rain tomorrow afternoon, they’re calling for over an inch, starting around noon, which could be good to bring the river up a bit and improve on at least the streamer fishing.  It does look to cool down significantly after the rain passes with overnight temps in the 50’s and daytime temps in the low-70’s through the weekend.  Lotsa’ Luck</p>\n",

The forecast for today and tomorrow is clear with a bit of cloud cover moving in on Wednesday and Thursday with some possibility of rain.  The upper West Branch at Stilesville is running 510 cfs and 50 degrees and down at Hale Eddy we have 810 cfs and 55 degrees with a slight stain. The East over at Harvard we have 200 cfs and 60 degrees and down at Fishs’ Eddy 407 cfs and 69 degrees.  The main down at Lordville is running 1200 cfs and 73 degrees, also up a bit after the rain last night.  The slight stain will definitely help with the streamer fishing if that’s your thing or if you’re tired of the upriver Sulphur game.  The slight increase in water should also help with the dry fly game as well, speeding everything up a bit.  There are still a few Sulphurs around up in the Deposit area in the #18-20 range with a lot of smaller fish to deal with as the mid-summer conditions continue.  It looks like it’s going to cool down a bit going into the weekend which should help a bit, especially the lower West and upper Mainstem.  We are still getting a few Isos and Cahills in the afternoons too, nice big flies to cover some water.  We should also see a few Olives in the #18-22 range with the clouds around.

The river came up a bit but is not stained this morning.  The West up at Stilesville is running 510 cfs and 50 degrees while down at Hale Eddy it is running 681 cfs and 53 to start the day.  Harvard on the upper East jumped up very slightly and is currently running 206 cfs and 60 degrees and down at Fishs’ Eddy we have 388 cfs and 69 degrees.  The main at Lordville is running 1170 cfs and 69 degrees.  It looks like the forecast for most of the week is good cloud cover with a possibility of light rain most afternoons which should help with the fishing a bit and hopefully get some Blue Winged Olives and other bugs going, especially on the lower half of the river system.  We are still seeing a few Sulphurs on the upper West in the afternoons but the pickings are getting slimmer by the week as it’s getting later in August.  Blind casting Isos or Cahills in the faster water is still working, especially when traveling in a boat.  Be on the lookout for some winged ants too in the #18-22 range, they’ve been around and can easily be mistaken for small Olives unless you actually grab and look at a few.  Temps look to be in the 80’s until mid-week then cool off a bit towards the weekend.  Lotsa’  Luck</p>\n",

The upper West Branch at Stilesville is running 510 cfs and 50 degrees and down at Hale Eddy we have 822 cfs and 54 degrees with some stain but around  3 foot of visibility at the bridge.  The slightly warmer water is due to the warm runoff.  We should expect some good surface activity and with the stained water we should have some slightly easier fishing compared to the gin clear 600 cfs we’ve had for over a month.  The streamer opportunities should also be good.  The upper East Branch at Harvard is running 197 cfs and 58 degrees and down at Fishs’ Eddy we have 327 cfs and 68 degrees.  We haven’t been over there this morning but from looking at the flow it looks like they didn’t get the storms we did last night.  The main is running 1160 cfs and 67 degrees this morning.  We should still see a few Sulphurs on the upper river in the afternoon hours.  We do still have good cloud cover that is supposed to stick around which make for a good day with the Blue Winged Olives, typically in the 18-22 size.  We are also seeing a few small, #18-20, Winged Ants which are very important once they start up and make a great fly to try over any feeding fish.  Cloud cover looks good over the next couple days too so should be a good weekend versus the high sun we’ve had over the last six weeks.  Lotsa’ Luck</p>\n",

Flows are pretty much the same other than a slight up and down with the release from Cannonsville over the last 24 hours which is pretty minor and won’t affect the fishing any.  We currently have 485 cfs at Stilesville and 50 degrees and down at Hale Eddy we have 616 cfs and 51 degrees. The East up at Harvard is running 194 cfs and 56 degrees and downriver at Fishs’ Eddy we are looking at 332 cfs and 67 degrees.  The main Delaware at Lordville is running 1020 cfs and 67 degrees as well.  Mornings have been productive with streamers if you are up at daybreak until 7:30 or so and usually about that time you can find a few fish feeding on top taking any surface but that comes down their lane.  This early there’s not really a hatch, more likely they’re rising to bugs from the night before or terrestrials are always good flies - like ants and beetles.  There have been some Tricos on the lower West, main and East Branch in the mornings usually showing up about this same time.  The upper West is still getting some decent Sulphurs starting around noon, give or take an hour, and will come and go throughout the afternoon.  As usual with the summer Sulphurs up top a lot of the fish are feeding on nymphs coming up through the water column, oftentimes right at the surface, causing you to see random body parts like fins and backs.  Droppers like pheasant tails, soft hackles or traditional wet flies fished as a dropper off the back of a visible dry fly.  We should have some Olives today as well due to the cloud cover, usually in the #18-22 range, and fish will look for the Olives even during a good Sulphur hatch.  The lower half of the West is seeing some Olives, Cahills and Isonychia,  with the Olives being the most prolific.  The Isos are great blind casting flies to cover some water if not much is happening on top and will bring fish up if you focus on getting good drifts and covering water.  The weather all week looks to be similar with some cloud cover and temps in the upper-70’s.  Lotsa’ Luck</p>\n",

It looks like some decent rain moving in on Tuesday which may be why they’ve cut the release back and the reservoir has dropped to under 80% which could be part of the reason.  Still good flows for mid-August and water temps are good as well.  The upriver Sulhpurs should be good for a few more weeks as they did start a bit late and typically go well into August.  Cahills and Isos will also be around for a while throughout the system.  There have been a few Tricos in the mornings, just not on the upper half of the West, and it can be a great time to get out on the water without a ton of competition and these cooler night temps really help to keep the upper main and East at seasonable temps.

We did get a little rain in the area the last few days but the West is still very clear and wasn’t affected too much.  The lower East was pretty dirty from the Beaverkill but the upper East is in good shape.  Stilesville is running 597 cfs and 51 degrees and Hale Eddy is down to 659 and 55 degrees, up slightly due to a little more water in the creeks but very clear still.  The upper East at Harvard is running 219 cfs and 63 degrees while down at Fishs’ Eddy we have 636 cfs and 70 degrees.  Lordville on the main Delaware is running 1510 cfs and 68 degrees today, up a bit still from the recent storms.  The upper West Branch has been the most consistent with bugs lately with the #18 Sulphurs still offering some activity usually starting around noon, give or take an hour, and going through the afternoon.  Up top you are seeing a few Isonychia and Cahills which you will see lower down on the West as well.  The fishing on the lower half of the West has been decent with less bugs on the water during the mid-day hours but also less people.  The fish you do find there are typically a bit easier to catch than the upriver Sulphur-eaters if the fly is presented properly.  Blind casting and nymphing are also solid options if there isn’t much going on up top.  Spinners in the evenings have been decent to pretty good depending on the conditions and where you are at on the river.  Small Blue Winged Olives have been around throughout the system and will be around for a while.

We could use a little rain and it should affect the river in a good way and maybe give us a little color to the water for a day or so but what they’re calling for will definitely not blow out the river.  It looks like some clouds moving in in the next couple hours which will help with the fishing as it’s been pretty sunny the last few weeks.

The Sulphurs upriver will be an option, starting around noon, but with the cloud cover and rain it would be nice to see some Olives and get a little activity on the lower West as well.  Mornings are good if you can get out - streamers from sunrise ‘till the sun pokes out, usually a few fish trash-feeding, then some Tricos if you’re lucky enough to find a few and they drop.  The lower West, main and East Branch are your best bet for the Tricos which are decent at times.  Blind casting some bigger bugs or terrestrials is also a good method to drum some fish up on those stretches as well.  Nymphing has been productive with pheasant tails and Iso nymphs too.

We’ve been pretty dry up here lately aside from a brief afternoon shower here and there.  Water levels on the West Branch are back to their normal levels which we’ve had for weeks now with Stilesville on the upper river just under 600 cfs and Hale Eddy just above with a temp of 50.

There have also been some Tricos in size #20-24 around on the lower West, upper main and the East - we just don’t see them on the upper West’s colder water.  Sulphurs around Deposit (upper West) are still the main bugs we’re looking for mid-day, usually starting around noon give or take an hour.  As most of you know the Sulphur-eaters are pretty picky and will test the patience of all but is a great place to find good bugs and rising fish mid-day.  Cahills and Isos are also great flies to pack for these later summer months and are great for covering water if there isn’t much happening.

It looks like pretty consistent weather for the next few days  and no rain in the forecast until mid-week and that looks iffy too.

As usual the fish beyond picky on the Sulphurs and will require all the tricks you know to be successful.  Droppers and wets in the film work well when the fish are feeding right below the surface, just try different patterns and the length of the dropper is also important.  It’s also a good time to try lower on the West and expect less bugs and less fish rising mid-day but when you do find them they are usually easier as they can’t be as picky as the trout during a prolific hatch.   Ants and beetles are great flies for those random risers.  Isonychia and Cahills are also good flies to prospect with or put over the fish feeding but there isn’t a specific happening.  They say we may get a bit of rain later tomorrow but the afternoon thunderstorms are always possible but not very reliable.  Lotsa’ Luck</p>\n",

The extra water into the West Branch is a great thing and will help to cool down the whole river, especially below Deposit.  The mid-day bugs up around Deposit should kick off around noon or so and continue ‘till the evening.  Keep your droppers and soft hackles handy as the fish are feeding below the surface a lot of the time and dropping those flies off the back of a good Sulphur dry can be very effective.  The Cahills and Isonychia will be around for a while and are always great for the random risers or to blind-cast with if not much is happening.  Nymphing with small Sulphur nymphs or pheasant tails is also effective if that’s your thing or if no fish are rising.

We’re still looking at Sulphurs in #18-20 and the upper West is going to be the best bet mid-day with bugs usually starting to show around 11am-1pm, depending on conditions, and go from there with spinners at dark. There are still some Cahills and Isos around too for the random risers or for blind-casting. It looks like pretty consistent temps all week with some rain tomorrow night which could be great if the river puffed up a bit. Lotsa’ Luck</p>\n",

Flows and today’s fishing won’t be too different than the last couple weeks with summer conditions.  The upper West Branch at Stilesville is running 589 cfs and 48 degrees and down at Hale Eddy we are looking at 606 cfs and 50 degrees.  The upper East Branch at Harvard is running 213 cfs and 59 degrees and down at Fishs’ Eddy the flow is 388 cfs and 68 degrees.  Lordville down on the mainstem is currently 1100 cfs and 68 degrees.  With the sun and clear skies the Deposit area is going to be the place to be mid-day for some Sulphur activity.  If you want to nymph or fish subsurface the lower half of the West is still cool and in great shape and you will see some random fish feeding and Isos and Cahills will be great bugs to put over them or even blind cast in the moving water with a lot less people compared to the upper river.  Droppers off of those bigger flies works well too if you want to double up with a #18 pheasant tail for a Sulphur nymph.  The bugs upriver have been starting late morning/early afternoon depending on the day with #18-20 Sulphurs in good numbers which will come and go through the afternoon.  It looks like tomorrow will be a bit cloudier with a chance of rain early in the week which is welcomed as its been pretty sunny and warm the last few weeks.  Lotsa’ Luck</p>\n",

Water levels have remained pretty consistent lately with the release from Stilesville remaining consistent since the thermal releases of last weekend.  We currently have just under 600 cfs and 48 degrees up at Stilesville and down at Hale Eddy we are looking at 632 cfs and 50 degrees.  The upper East Branch at Harvard is running 219 cfs and 58 degrees and down at Fishs’ Eddy we have 426 cfs and 66  degrees.  Lordville down on the mainstem is now at 1170 cfs and 67 degrees.  These cool mornings are a nice time to get out before the sun burns off the fog for a few hours of fishing and nymphing and streamer fishing are usually pretty good and most likely you will have the river to yourself.  The Deposit area has been the place to be mid-day with some #18-20 Sulphurs starting to show up early afternoon in decent numbers but be prepared for some picky eaters.  Cripples, droppers and your favorite emerger patterns will helpful along with some patience and good drifts.  We are still getting some Isonychia in #10-12 along with some #14-16 Cahills too.  Their spinners are also good patterns for the evening along with Sulphur spinners which tend to drop in large numbers when they do.  Small ants and beetles are great flies this time of year and as we move towards August be on the lookout for winged-ants which are as good as any hatch when they’re around.  Nymphing with small Sulphur-specific nymphs and pheasant tails is always a good option if the bugs are slow.  It looks like pretty similar weather all weekend with no rain in the forecast.

The heavy storms that came through yesterday missed us for the most part and although water levels came up slightly everything is still in great shape, actually better than before the rain with a slight stain to the water.  The West up at Stilesville is running 597 cfs and 48 degrees while down at Hale Eddy we have 828 cfs and 53 degrees with a slight stain to the water and as you come across feeder streams you’ll likely have a bit coming out of them for a while.  The East Branch at Harvard is running 358 cfs and 56 degrees which is a big help after the recent heat wave.  On the lower East at Fishs’ Eddy we have 876 cfs and 65 degrees, again a big improvement with more water and cooler temps.  The main Delaware at Lordville is running 1640 cfs and 63 degrees.  We should have some good Blue Winged Olives today in size #18-22 with the cloud cover and you can expect good Sulphurs in #18, especially around Deposit from early afternoon on.  The Isonychia in size #10-12 will be around for a while and are always great blind-casting flies and are also great flies to support a dropper if that’s your thing.  We should have decent streamer opportunity with the stain we’ve got which won’t stick around for too long as the forecast is for a bit cooler temps, in the 70’s, with no rain in the immediate future.

With the cloud cover that looks to be around all day and hopefully some rain moving in we should have a good day on the water with the same bugs we’ve been dealing with for a while.  #18 Sulphurs starting early afternoon in the Deposit area is going to be the go-to for a while and will last for the next month or so.  We could have a good bug day with the cloud cover which we haven’t had for a while with some 18-22 Blue Winged Olives, some Cahills and Isonychia.

The bugs typically come and go throughout the afternoon and into evening but once they start there are going to be steady targets if you know what to look for- sneaky fish that are very particular.  You’ll also see some Cahills and Isonychia as well and sometimes they will be better choices than the Sulphurs, especially when moving in a boat or hitting those random risers.  On the tricky Sulphur eaters ants and beetles are always great choices if the cripples and droppers fail.  The increased water due to the thermal conditions is a big help and will continue until at least Sunday at noon.  Stay on the water (hydration) and Lotsa’ luck.</p>\n",

The flows and temps over on the East Branch are 242 cfs and 60 degrees at Harvard and 735 cfs and 68 degrees at Fishs Eddy. The Main Stem at Lordville is 1750 cfs and 66 degrees. As far as the bugs go, we are still seeing plenty of  Sulphurs in size 16-18, Blue Wing Olives in size 20-22, Iso’s in size 10-12, and Light Cahill in size 14. The fishing up river in Deposit has still been the most consistent in hatches and rising fish. We have also been seeing prolific spinner falls at dark too, so it would be wise to stay out late. With the Sulphurs hatching strong it is always good to have a verity of different sulphur patterns on you like cripples, knock down duns, duns, emergers, and nymphs. You will see a lot of fish rising right below the surface, so putting on a pheasant tail dropper on is very effective. Iso’s and Light Cahill are always good blind casting flies and are good flies to choose for sporadic risers. Blue Wing Olives are also another great fly during a heavy Sulphur hatch, just throwing something a little different at them can be effective. The temps going into this weekend look to be pretty hot, so if you plan on going out this weekend be sure to stay hydrated and wear plenty of sun screen. There is also a chance of a thunderstorm too over the next couple of days. Losta’ Luck  </p>\n",

On the bug front not much has changed over the last week with some Sulphurs starting in the early afternoon and upriver around Deposit being the place to be for the most bugs and cool water temps.  As we’ve moved into summer weather the mornings have a good time to be on the water with a few fish trash-feeding on leftover bugs from the night before and are usually less picky than the fish during the middle of a hatch.  Small spinners and terrestrials are always good choices for the morning fish.  During the Sulphur hatch the fish are picky as usual and having a good selection of cripples, patience and sub-surface flies to use as droppers is essential.  Isonychia and Cahills are good bugs are still around and make great flies for that randomly rising fish you don’t want to spend a ton of time on or also make great blind casting flies.

We are still seeing some #10-12 Isonychia throughout the day and throughout the river as well.  Iso nymphs or a Zug Bug in the appropriate size are great nymphs, also small Sulphur nymphs or pheasant tails work well too.  As it typically is with the fish feeding during the summer Sulphur hatch a lot of the fish are feeding right below the surface and a dropper like a pheasant tail or Sulphur wet can work really well.

We are also seeing a few Grey Fox in #14-16, small #18-22 Blue Winged Olives and some #10 Isonychia sporadically throughout the afternoon.  As usual in July the fish have their A-game at eating bugs and creative Sulphur patterns like cripples and subsurface emergers really help.  Especially when you have lots of Sulphurs on the water the larger fish will only pick of the most vulnerable stages.  The nymphing can be really good at these levels with the highly defined riffles and seams with small Sulphur nymphs or even a larger Iso that can be dead drifted or swung in the current.  Blind casting the Isos can also be very effective, especially from the boat when you’re moving down river.  They are calling for some cloud cover to pick up as the day goes on with some rain tomorrow afternoon which would really be the best case scenario.  They are calling for over a half inch which will quickly be absorbed as it’s been pretty dry the last ten days or so.  Lotsa’ Luck </p>\n",

The upper East at Harvard is running 301 cfs and 52 degrees while down at Fishs’ Eddy we are looking at 922 cfs and 59 degrees.  The main Delaware is running 1830 cfs and 61 degrees.  Yesterday fished ok and definitely fished better on the upper West versus the rest of the river, even in the afternoon hours and into evening.  The lower West didn’t have a ton of bugs, maybe due to the cooler weather/pressure of the front moving through but there were some fish rising just not a lot of bugs for consistency.  We did have better bugs on the upper West, around Deposit with the usual Sulphurs, Cahills and a few Isonychia.  We are back into the warmer weather pattern which we had all last week and it fished very well.  We do have much lower water than we’ve had lately which is going to change things, especially as we move into summer weather patterns.  It does look like more cloud cover starting tomorrow and going through the week which is a big plus.  Lotsa’ Luck </p>\n",

The flows are still dropping slowly throughout the system as we didn’t get much rain this week despite the storms in the area.  The upper West Branch at Stilesville is now running 629 cfs and 47 degrees and down at Hale Eddy we are looking at 715 cfs and 51 degrees.  The upper East Branch at Harvard is currently 436 cfs and 51 degrees and down at Fishs’ Eddy we are looking at 1120 cfs and 60 degrees.  Lordville down on the mainstem is running 2130 cfs and 62 degrees.  We should have a good day out there today with some #16 Sulphurs starting in the afternoon hours and getting better as the day progresses.  We are also seeing the usual bugs amongst the Sulphurs with some #14-16 Cahills, some #10 Isonychia and #18-22 Olives.  Nymphing has been productive with Sulphur-sized pheasant tails and Sulphur-specific nymphs.  Isonychia nymphs are also good options when going subsurface.  We should have some good spinners tonight - #16 Ginger Spinners are going to be essential flies for the last hour or so of daylight.  As the fish get more pressured and educated ants and beetles are great options, especially mid-day.

We should see some Olives today as well in the #18-22 range.  Be sure to pack some Isonychia in size #10 as there have been a good number of them around in the afternoons.  It looks like this afternoon will only be good cloud cover with no more rain, maybe a little shower, but nothing to worry about.  Tomorrow looks to be cooler and in the 60’s with good cloud cover.

Water levels are still dropping on the West Branch due to release from the reservoir from Cannonsville.  With air temps already 70 you’ll need to be prepared for the heat and sun but we should start to see some bugs in the early afternoon hours.  Stilesville on the upper West is currently running 803 cfs and 46 degrees, about half of what they were releasing a week ago.  Down at Hale Eddy we have 911 cfs and 48 degrees, an excellent level where we still have some cold water on the whole West, you can float or wade comfortably as well.  Harvard on the upper East Branch is now running 825 cfs and 48 degrees and down at Fishs’ Eddy on the lower East is running 1540 cfs and 57 degrees.  Lordville down on the mainstem is now at 2780 cfs and 61 degrees.  These are great temps and flows for this time of year with this warm of weather and helps to keep everyone spread out and happy.  We have been getting some good bugs here on the West in the afternoon ‘till dark with the Sulphurs in #14-16 being the bugs to look out for.  The big fish, as usual this time of year, are getting sneaky and feeding right off of the bank with super-subtle rise forms taking the most vulnerable bugs they see coming down.  There have also been good Isonycia in size #10 and are great prospecting flies this time of year.  You’re not going to see a blanket hatch of them but if you are on the water you will see them throughout the day.  The East Branch and main Delaware have been fishing well in the evening with spinners and duns but it can be slow on top during the day but nymphing and swinging wets can be productive.  We have also been seeing a few Grey Fox and Cahills in the #14 range was well is you see a bug in that range with mottled wings.  Small Blue Winged Olives are always around too and it’s a great fly to try on a fussy fish that won’t eat your multiple Sulphur patterns.  Lots’a Luck and enjoy the weekend!</p>\n",

Even in the high sun we’ve been getting some good bugs mid-afternoon and the fish are looking up.  They have continued to step down the flow up at Stilesville on the West Branch and we are currently looking at 1150 cfs and 46 degrees while down at Hale Eddy we have 1330 cfs and 48 degrees.  At these levels those who know the river are going to find plenty of places to get in and wade, maybe not all the way across the river but enough to make it happen.

The main Delaware down at Lordville is now running 3500 cfs and 58 degrees.  These are really great levels and water temps heading into July with all of the rivers fishable and fishing well.  We are still getting Sulphurs in the #14-16 range with a few #18’s starting to show up and will eventually take over the mid-day bug program up around Deposit.  Nymphing before the hatch gets going is working pretty well with small Sulphur imitations or pheasant tails.  We are seeing a few larger #14 Cahills mixed in as well as some #10 Isonychia which are always great blind-casting flies.  With these warm, calm evenings we are getting some spinners of the above bugs along with some more hatching as well.

We’ve also been seeing some #14-16 Cahills, #18-20 Olives, Drakes on the East and some Isoncyhia throughout the system.

We’ve got some color throughout the system, not muddy but a nice chalky haze to the river with 4-5’ of visibility depending on where you are.  Some feeders are still pumping dirty water into the system so below them you will have a bit of mud before it mixes as it moves downstream.

We did have some Sulphurs in #14-16 yesterday and should today as well later this afternoon.  It also looks like a great Olive day as well.  We should get some spinners as well with the clear skies and no rain.  Lotsa’ luck</p>\n",

We had bright sun and warmer temps the last couple days which didn’t help the mid-day fishing any but the evenings were pretty good.  During the day nymphing or blind-casting was a good option with a few bugs popping here and there but no notable hatch till we got later into the day.  The water levels have continued to drop and the coming rain will be welcomed.  The upper West Branch at Stilesville is currently 589 cfs and 44 degrees and down at Hale Eddy we have 632 cfs and 47 degrees.

Spent caddis in the #16-18 range have been good flies if you can find some fish trash-feeding mid-day, eating whatever comes their way.  We have been seeing pretty good Sulphurs in the #14-16 range later in the day with good bugs the last hour and a half of the day.  With the change in weather and good clouds we are hoping for better bugs with the better conditions.  Blue Winged Olives in #18-20 are always solid choices when you have some decent clouds and rain.  We are also seeing some #8-10 March Browns which make great blind-casting flies, always an excellent way to drum up some fish if it’s slow on top.  We are seeing some Drakes down on the main and East Branch where they live and a few on the lower West.  Lotsa’ Luck</p>\n",

We’ve had some pretty good fishing the past few days with some decent bugs throughout the afternoon with no blanket hatch of any one bug, usually a variety of what we’ve been seeing with fish picking off the vulnerable ones that come down their lane - think spent caddis, spinners and cripples.  That along with blind-casting in likely spots or over areas you’ve seen fish rising will produce some great results if you have faith in it, maybe a few March Browns or a large Sulphur.  As far as bugs you should expect #14-16 Sulphurs, #18-20 Olives, #8-10 March Browns, #18 Tan caddis  and a few Drakes on the main Delaware and East Branch.  The spent caddis has been a great fly all week and is hard to beat throughout the day with the trash-feeders sipping whatever looks dead, spinners are a great option too.  In the evening have spinners of the above bugs in the appropriate sizes with all of them being rusty in color except the Sulphurs which will be a ginger color.  Lotsa’ Luck </p>\n",

Rusty spinners in the appropriate sizes of all those bugs except the Sulphurs, which will be a ginger spinner, are must haves as well.

We are supposed to get a half-inch tonight into tomorrow which won’t affect the fishing or rivers much but may puff them up a bit and prolong the spill from the reservoirs.  The upper West Branch at Stilesville is now at 1870 cfs and 52 degrees.  Down at Hale Eddy we have 2350 cfs and 46 degrees with very clear water.  The upper East Branch at Harvard is now at 1140 and 47 degrees while down at Fishs’ Eddy we are looking at 2330 and 51 degrees.  The mainstem at Lordville is now 5320 cfs and 51 degrees as well.  With the abundance of water everything is very fishable at these levels and the fishing over the weekend has been pretty good with lots of bugs, especially on the West, with great fish looking up.  Bugs have been the same with a few March Browns added to the mix, especially down on the main.

A few March Browns too on the lower East and Mainstem.  It looks like a good night for spinners which will all be rusty in the appropriate sizes.

Today’s forecast is for partly clearing skies and highs in the low-60’s.  After three days of 40-degree weather with steady, light rain the warmer temps are nice to have.  Despite the crumby weather we had some good fishing and lots of bugs.  Yesterday was on of the better bug days you’ll ever see here and the fish were feeding on top all afternoon.  There have been lots of phone calls the past few days concerning the weather and people surprised there were great bugs and fish feeding in the all-day-rains.  Those days are always so much better than any bright and sunny day - if you like to catch fish at least.  It’s pretty amazing that this is shocking to people.  If you shy away from fishing when it’s rainy or cool you’re going to miss some of best days with minimal pressure.  The next couple days look dry and in the 60’s so we should have some good fishing.  The rivers are dropping for the most part with the upper West Branch at Stilesville running 1610 cfs and 44 degrees while Hale Eddy down lower is at 2950 cfs and 44 degrees.  The upper East Branch at Harvard is now 1430 cfs and 44 degrees while down at Fishs’ Eddy we have 3760 cfs and 46 degrees.  The mainstem at Lordville is now 8540 cfs and 46 degrees.  We saw plenty of Hendricksons, Olives and Blue Quills yesterday so today should be some of the same.  With the clearer weather we should have some spinners sometime today as well.

The stained water will definitely be much better for streamer fishing which was getting tough due to the clear water we had.  Sunday was pretty bugless on most sections but yesterday some anglers had some surface activity with BWO’s in the afternoon.

Today’s forecast is very similar to yesterday’s with some rain later today with the large parts of the storm going north and south of us.  It was chilly with rain yesterday but fish were being caught, primarily below the surface with nymphs and streamers.  There were a few fish rising here and there with very little mayfly activity if any but some midges here and there.  Tomorrow looks to be cool as well with very little rain but some cloud cover until the temps rise on Wednesday and continue to rise into the weekend.

Down at Hale Eddy we have 1840 cfs and 43 degrees to start the day, again a bit cooler due to the lack of warm water coming over the reservoir but also no real stain to the water.

With all of the hatching going on fish are still feeding a lot sub surface and in the film taking the bugs before they surface.  Rusty spinners, which all of the above mayflies will molt into, in the sizes of the appropriate mayfly are must-haves for this time of year  You just have to put your time in and observe while getting good drifts with some different bugs.  The streamer fishing is still solid and will get better with a little stain if the rain does increase.

The upper East Branch at Harvard is now down to 1400 cfs and 43 degrees and down at Fishs’ Eddy we have 2910 cfs and 46 degrees.  Down on the main Delaware we are looking at 6500 cfs and 45 degrees.  All of the rivers are in great shape for floating with some hard-to-beat fishing with lots of bugs to keep the fish happy.  We had a lot of bugs yesterday with air temps in the mid-50’s with Olives in the #18-20 range, #16-18 Blue Quills and lots of #14-16 Hendricksons.  We could also see spinners, all Rusty, any time during the day.  We are seeing a few #16-18 Stoneflies and Chimarra caddis but with the mayflies on the water we’ve been seeing the stones and caddis are pretty much irrelevant.  The streamer fishing conditions are still very good but once the bugs start who’s throwing streamers?  We are supposed to get a little rain the rest of the week but it looks like nothing significant until we get to the weekend, and just like the last three weekends we can just hope for the best.  Lotsa’ Luck</p>\n",

We have temps today in the upper-50’s later this afternoon with a little rain later tonight.  Despite the colder temps and snow this weekend we did have some good fishing and even fish every afternoon feeding on top.  The rivers are dropping still, some quicker than others, and are all pretty clear at the moment.  Stilesville on the upper West Branch is running 2270 cfs and 45 degrees while down at Hale Eddy we have 2970 cfs and 42 degrees.  The East up at Harvard is now 1790 cfs and 41 degrees and downriver at Fishs’ Eddy we have 3900 cfs and 43 degrees.  The mainstem at Lordville is running 7530 cfs and 42 degrees.  We do have a bit of rain in the forecast coming up this week but nothing significant to affect the fishing.  The streamer fishing was pretty good this past weekend after the rains of Friday and Saturday and we even had good dry fly fishing in the afternoon hours if you hung in there.  The Blue Winged Olives in #18-20 and Blue Quills in #16-18 have been very good the last few weeks, we are also seeing #14-16 Hendricksons which should be good this week with the warmer temps.  We are also seeing a few #16-18 Black Stoneflies still around and small Chimarra caddis in the #18-20 range which aren’t as important on top if the water is covered in Olives.  With both reservoirs spilling for a while wade fishing is a distant thought on the Delaware but there are some smaller streams that have been fishing very well if a boat is not an option.

Currently the river here at Hale Eddy has more of a green tint, not really muddy.  Stilesville is down to 2310 cfs and 45 degrees with clear water up that high and down at Hale Eddy we have 3150 and 42 degrees which has dropped about 500 cfs since yesterday morning.  On the East up at Harvard we have 1790 cfs and 41 degrees and below the Beaverkill at Fishs’ Eddy we are down to 3900 cfs and 43 degrees.  The mainstem has dropped to 8450 cfs and 43 degrees, down a few thousand from last night.  Despite the snow and cooler temps yesterday there were a lot of boats out the fishing was pretty good with streamers the first half of the day and in the afternoon there were some decent bugs and fish feeding on them.  We are still seeing good Olives in the #18-20 range with these cloudy conditions along with #16-18 Blue Quills and some #14-16 Hendricksons too.

We are supposed to get some rain throughout the day with about a half-inch of overall accumulation and highs around 60.  The rain and cloud cover should be good for the fishing as long as it doesn’t get too heavy at times.  The rivers have been dropping all week and the fishing has been good and we’ve had pretty good bugs all week.  The overcast and rain will definitely help the streamer bite.  This time of year the crumby days are oftentimes the best, especially on top. The upper West Branch at Stilesville is flowing 2080 cfs and 48 degrees and downriver at Hale Eddy 2520 cfs and 44 degrees.  The upriver temp is still warm due to the spill over the reservoir which is going to continue for a while.  The upper East Branch at Harvard is now 1220 and 44 degrees while downriver at Fishs’ Eddy we have 2460 cfs and  48 degrees.  Lordville down on the main Delaware is now at 5430 cfs and 48 degrees.  These water levels and conditions are great for this time of year and those who have access to boats. The Beaverkill is down to 911 cfs so is getting better for the wade anglers.  We’ve still been seeing a few different bugs with #18-20 Blue Winged Olives, #16-18 Blue Quills, #14-16 Hendricksons, #18-20 Chimarra Caddis and still a few #16-18 Stoneflies too.

Yesterday was pretty good for most anglers with some so-so streamer fishing and no shortage of bugs on the water.  The streamer fishing in general is getting tougher due to the pressure, think 20+ boats a day on the West, all throwing similar stuff in similar places.  The bugs have been pretty good the last few weeks and gaining consistency lately.  We have a mixed bag of #18-20 Olives, #16-18 Blue Quills, #14-16 Hendrickson along with some small #18-20 Chimarra Caddis which aren’t super relevant on top with these flows.

We had some good bugs yesterday with a mixed bag of #18-20 Blue Winged Olives, #16-18 Blue Quills, #20 Chimarra Caddis and some #14-16 Hendricksons - all starting early afternoon.  The hatch started early and was the strongest from early to mid-afternoon and later it became a bit sporadic as did the fish.  The streamer fishing is decent and you have to work it with the high volume of water, getting down as deep as possible and a lot of the fish are going to be tight to the bank with these higher flows.

It looks pretty dry most of the week with some minor rain possible towards the weekend.  As of now it doesn’t look like anything too significant if any at all, exactly what we need to get the flows down.  As far as bugs we’re pretty much on schedule for a normal year with Blue Winged Olives, some Blue Quills, Caddis and a few Hendricksons around which will likely pick up with these warm temps coming up.  The upper West at Stilesville is dropping slowly with clear water and a flow of 3470 cfs and 44 degrees to start the day - a bit warmer than usual due to the volume of warm-water spilling from the surface of the reservoir.  The West Branch down at Hale Eddy is now 4420 cfs and 44 degrees today with good visibility.  At these levels we are going to be streamer fishing to cover water and looking for some rising fish in the afternoon hours in the slower areas of the river.  The East Branch at Harvard is running 3050 cfs and 43 degrees and down at Fishs’ Eddy we have 5880 cfs and 46 degrees.  The East still has some decent stain to it as does the Beaverkill which is running 2000 this morning.  The rivers will continue to drop slowly throughout the week with no rain events but will be far from wadeable for a while.  With both reservoirs spilling we will be getting significant releases along with the spill.  Only when the spilling is over will they start to cut the releases back.  In the mean time we should have good fishing via boats, with the surface activity picking up as the rivers drop, very similar to last week before the rain on Friday.  Lotsa’ Luck</p>\n",

There still is a large portion of the storm which is still south of us but it is moving just east of us sparing us from additional inches of rain.  A lot of last night’s storm did the same thing and stayed to the East - again sparing us from a lot of the storm.  The West Branch at Stilesville is up to 2910 cfs and 41 degrees.  Downriver at Hale Eddy we now have 4930 cfs and 46 degrees.  It is pretty turbid on the West this morning and the river crested overnight and we hope it stays trending that way with some of the storm still close to us.  The upper East didn’t get hit as bad last night with the river at Harvard now running 2500 cfs and 44 degrees.  The lower East Branch at Fishs’ Eddy is now running 5190 cfs and 49 degrees.  The mainstream at Lordville is now 12,000 cfs and 49 degrees.

Today should be good with the warmer temps and it looks like the rain isn’t going to move in until 3pm or so.  Hopefully it isn’t too heavy at first and we can get some bugs and fishing in as it is going to get dirty again with the rains moving in.

Down at Hale Eddy we are looking at 3550 cfs and 42 degrees, still with a little stain which helps with the streamer fishing vs gin-clear water.

The mainstem at Lordville is running 9320 cfs and 44 degrees.  There has been a lot of streamer fishing the last few days with some nice fish being caught but the fishing hasn’t been easy.  It’s a lot of work, consistently keeping your fly in the water and in the right place, cast after cast is what works in the end.  We are seeing some decent hatches of Olive and Blue Quills during the afternoon hours but the higher water has kept the fish down for the most part, with a few fish rising in slower water.  With the dropping water and good cloud cover we could see and increase in activity today.

The West Branch at Stilesville is now running 2880 cfs and 39 degrees, this is the only section that is still rising a bit as the bubble of water moves over the reservoir.  The water is pretty clear from Stiles to Oquaga creek.  There is now 2130 cfs coming into the backside of the Cannonsville from Walton.    Hale Eddy is now running 3950 cfs and 41 degrees with several feet of visibility, enough for any type of fishing.  Hale Eddy is pretty steady at the moment due to the increasing spill and the slowing runoff.  There were some bugs yesterday, Olives and Paraleps with a few Quill Gordons.  If you are looking for rising fish, look for the slowest possible - think up against the bank in the side channels.  The upper East Branch at Harvard is running 4020 cfs and 39 degrees and has been dropping slowly.  The lower East Branch down at Fishs’ Eddy is currently 6950 cfs and 41 degrees, which is also dropping quickly.

The West Branch down at Hale Eddy is now 4040 cfs and 40 degrees with several feet of visibility and there will definitely be fisherman on the water today and with the stain streamer fishing conditions are perfect and the water is certainly clear enough for fish to eat dries.  With the sun we will likely be seeing some Blue Quills in the #16-18 range.  The West did crest early yesterday and then later started to rise again due to the spill coming over the top of the reservoir which will last for a while, how long will be determined by how much rain we get.  If you have access to a boat or a guide there is no reason not to expect good fishing over the next couple days, likely a lot better than you expect.  The upper East Branch at Harvard is now 6220 cfs  and 39 degrees and dropping while down at Fishs’ Eddy we have 10,800 cfs and 40 degrees, down to about half of what it was yesterday afternoon.  The East Branch is going to take a little longer to recover just because it drains so much land compared to the West, getting all the water from the Willowemoc and Beaverkill.  We are in pretty good shape considering the rain we got, with good fishable water now via boat.  We won’t be wading for a while which is very common this time of year and to be expected.  The little wading we had the last month was just an unusual bonus as it was pretty dry the last six weeks which is rare in March and April but will all of the water we’ve had the last nine months wade fishing is going to be rare for a while.

It’s currently running 1610 cfs and 40 degrees, after peaking at 1660 earlier this morning.  Yesterday, before the rain, it was 1590 cfs so only a 20 cfs difference after the rain.  This level is likely to rise slowly as the spill over the reservoir increases and we could see that happen over a few days as water fills in from the West Branch above the reservoir.  The DEC’s webpage showing reservoir levels doesn’t show Cannonsville spilling yet but that will change.  The flow at Hale Eddy is now 4010 cfs  and 46 degrees and is highly stained with debris and unfishable at the moment.  Harvard on the upper East Branch is blown and running 3830 cfs and 45 degrees while the lower East Branch after the Beaverkill (16,100cfs) at Fishs’ Eddy is running 20,400 cfs and 49 degrees.  The mainstem at Lordville is now 11,200 and 47 degrees and will at least double pretty soon when the water from the East Branch gets down there.  The upper West is going to be the place to be as everything starts to clear and thankfully the West does clear up very quickly.

With the sunnier weather for today we could see a few more stoneflies int he #16-18 range and we’ve been seeing a few Paraleps/Blue Quills in the #16-18 range which should pick up in the coming days.  There have been a few Hendricksons #14-16 around randomly but with this coming week’s temps we could start to see more of them and Quill Gordons #12-14 any day now.  The Beaverkill did get hit pretty good with the rain so the lower East will likely get some stain throughout the day.  Lotsa’ Luck</p>\n",

      "</h1><p class=\"\" style=\"white-space:pre-wrap;\">We have some cloud cover to start this Friday morning with a bit of wind out of the southeast.  The forecast is calling for warmer temps than yesterday with highs in the upper-50’s and wind peaking out at 13mph in the afternoon.  The release on the West and East Branches did go up a bit overnight, likely anticipating the rain tonight, which is likely to make Cannnonsville (99.2% full) and Pepacton (99.7%) spill in the coming days.  Stilesville is now running 929 cfs and 39 degrees and down at Hale Eddy we have 1190 cfs and 40 degrees.  The East Branch is running 788 cfs up at Harvard and 40 degrees and below the Beaverkill at Fishs’ Eddy we’ve got 2030 cfs and 41 degrees.  The mainstream at Lordville is currently running 3650 cfs and 41 degrees.  The temps outside yesterday peaked in the mid-40’s with good cloud cover an the fishing was great.  Tons of Blue Winged Olives in the #18-20 range all afternoon, as good of a hatch as you will ever see and the fish were eating them.  It’s good testament that once the hatches get going early season a cooler day with crumby weather isn’t a bad thing and oftentimes ends up being a great thing, especially when the majority of angler don’t go out cause they’re scared of a little weather.  The main point is, sunny days are never going to fish as well as the days with bad weather despite the temperature.  There are still some stoneflies around in the #16-20 range and a dark Elk Hair Caddis works well for them.  There have been a few Blue Quills #16-20 around and even the odd Hendrickson.  The next week should be a good one and it’s a pretty safe bet to expect the water to rise with the rain coming and change to the reservoirs.  As for the streamer fishing a little stain would help.  The fish have seen a fair amount of streamers lately and the water is clear.  Lotsa’ Luck</p>\n",

It’s supposed to hit 46 later this afternoon.  We’ve had some good fishing lately for the second week of April with some solid streamer fishing and a few fish eating dries later in the day.  Obviously the quality of fishing this time of year is really dependent on the air temp and weather of the given day.  Flows are holding steady with 741 up at Stilesville on the West Branch and 39 degrees.  Hale Eddy is running 1030 cfs and 41 degrees this morning.  The upper East Branch up at Harvard is running 643 cfs and 42 degrees while down at Fishs’ Eddy we have 2780 cfs and 43 degrees.  The mainstream at Lordville is running 4870 cfs and 44 degrees.  Today is likely to be a decent streamer day and for those with boats the fishing now is all about covering water, so longer floats are going to pay off.  We should have some bugs this afternoon and we can only hope the fish are looking up.  Tomorrow the temps get back into the 50’s and continue to creep up into the weekend.  Lotsa’ Luck</p>\n",

It’s nice it didn’t get below freezing last night which helps keep the water temp up a bit.  Temps today are going to peak in the low-60’s this afternoon with some rain coming from 2-4pm.  The flows are remaining pretty steady with 817 cfs and 39 up at Stilesville on the West and down at Hale Eddy we are looking at 1130 cfs and 41 degrees.

The main Delaware at Lordville is now 4450 cfs and 45 degrees.  We should have another good day on the water, hopefully the rain doesn’t affect the bugs in afternoon, which is coming right when we are getting the majority of fish coming up durning the warmest part of the day.  The streamer fishing has been good, as conditions are ideal with a slight stain/tint to the water which is typical this time of year with all of the feeder streams running full.  We’re still looking at #18-22 Blue Winged Olives and some Dark Stoneflies in the #16-20 range but if we keep getting these warm temps it won’t be too long before we start to see some Blue Quills and Hendricksons.

We did get some rain overnight but it didn’t affect the rivers at all turbidity-wise, everything is still looking great.  We currently have 929 cfs up at Stilesville with a temp of 39 to start the day.  Down at Hale Eddy we are looking at 1270 cfs and 41 degrees.  The upper East is running 686 cfs and 43 degrees at Harvard and downriver at Fishs’ Eddy we have 2080 cfs and 46 degrees - pretty nice temps for a morning in April.  The mainstream at Lordville is running 3670 cfs and 47 degrees this morning.  The streamer fishing has been pretty good lately with warmer temps this past weekend and there are bugs around in the afternoon.  These warmer water temps are really going to get things going and it looks like the air temps this week are going to be great and no snow which is a plus.  Today and tomorrow are going to be cloudy with a chance of rain tomorrow afternoon which is perfect weather for the Blue Winged Olives.  There have been pretty good Stoneflies around too in the #16-20 range and a dark-bodied elk hair caddis are great dries when they’re on the water.  Lotsa’ Luck</p>\n",

Stilesville on the upper West is 817 cfs and 38 degrees and down at Hale Eddy it’s running 1100 cfs and 38 degrees.  The upper East at Harvard is now 456 cfs and 37 degrees while the lower East at Fishs’ Eddy is running 1630 cfs and 37 as well.  The main Delaware at Lordville is running 3250 cfs and 37 degrees.  Clarity throughout the system is good with a spring green tint to the water.  Today is warmest day we’ve had all week and should be a good recipe for some bugs later in the day.  The temps for the next few days coming up look great so we should start to get a bit more consistency as the water temps warm.  Nymphing and streamer fishing will also pick up as the air temps warm up.  The bugs you’re likely to see are small Blue Winged Olives in the #18-22 range and small pheasant tails below the surface for their nymphs.  There are still some stoneflies around too and small Copper Johns or stonefly nymphs are good flies to bounce off of the bottom.  We should see these bugs later today and 3-6pm is going to be the warmest time on the water.  The streamer fishing is going to be popular for a while with the higher water.  Focus on the slower moving sections of water this time of year.  With the warm air temps for next week things will pick up quickly and should offer the last opportunity for some good fishing without the crowds.  Lotsa’ Luck  </p>\n",

Stilesville is now running 817 cfs and 37 degrees, down at Hale Eddy we have 1100 cfs and 38 degrees.  The wind is also going to be pretty mild today, mostly under 10 mph, which is a plus after the high winds earlier this week.  The upper East Branch at Harvard is running 488 cfs and 38 degrees and down on the lower East at Fishs’ Eddy we have 1690 cfs and 40 degrees.  The mainstem at Lordville is running 3310 cfs and 41 degrees.  The fishing today could be decent and the water on the upper East and West Branch are wadeable.  The reservoirs are all very full and will more than likely start spilling early next week, making the chance to wade anywhere on the Delaware system pretty tough if not impossible.  The weekend temps look a lot better than what we’ve been getting this week with highs Saturday in the mid-50’s and Sunday in the mid-60’s.  Still Olives and stoneflies will be the bugs until we get some more days with warmer temps.  The hatches this year seem to be on schedule with a normal year with more mayfly activity picking up the second to third week of April.  It looks like next week’s temps are in the 60’s with much warmer temps at night which is just as important as the daytime temps.  Lotsa’ Luck   </p>\n",

With these nice and warm air temps and sudden increase in the release on the West Branch we should have great dry fly fishing all day.  With the fish rising already this morning it should be a great day on the water, especially on April 1.  Just kidding, now for reality.   We’ve got a cold morning to start April with an air temp of 25 this morning (feels like 16 with wind) with some light flurries in the air with a high in the upper-30’s.  They did increase the flows/release overnight on the West Branch, bringing the river at Stilesville to 669 cfs and 37 degrees.  Hale Eddy is now up to 1320 cfs and 39 degrees.  The upper East Branch at Harvard is running 576 cfs and 37 degrees while downriver at Fishs’ Eddy we have 3000 cfs and 37 degrees as well.  The main Delaware at Lordville is running 5830 cfs and 38 degrees.  Fly fishing today under these conditions will be tough, with bottom-bouncing some nymphs or fishing streamers slow and deep being your best bet ‘till temps warm up a bit.  Small nymphs like pheasant tails in the 18-20 range as well as dark stonefly nymphs in the same size are going to be your best bet for nymphing.  The good news is that the temps are going to be quite a bit warmer, in the 50’s most of the days, with temps increasing as the week winds down.   It looks to be pretty dry with some possible rain Friday.  Lotsa’ Luck</p>\n",

The rivers are all currently in great shape with some color from the recent rains  and runoff but there are still some wading opportunities on the upper East and West Branches.  Tomorrow, April 1st, the upper East and West Branch (PA border upstream) open to fishing for the year.  The upper West Branch at Stilesville is running 203 cfs and 39 degrees and downriver at Hale Eddy we have 958 cfs and 43 degrees.  Hale Eddy has some color to it, not dirty but the deep green color of spring runoff.  The upper East Branch at Harvard is 591 cfs and 43 degrees and down below the Beaverkill (2200 cfs) at Fishs’ Eddy we have 3380 cfs and 42 degrees.  The mainstream at Lordville is running 5480 cfs an 44 degrees.  With several warm days this week the fishing was decent in the afternoons with some fish even looking up to small Blue Winged Olives in the #18-20 range as well as some Stoneflies in the #16-18 range.  For the stoneflies on top a dark bodied caddis works very well.  Nymphing and streamer fishing will be your best bet for the remainder of the day.  Small, dark 16-20 Copper Johns or Stonefly nymphs would be good flies to start with.  Also, small Pheasant tails nymphs in the 18-20 range for the BWO’s will work.  For the streamers, many patterns will work and fishing them slow is going to be your best bet and even focusing on slower pools and deeper slots versus hitting the banks this time of year.  It looks like a day and a half of cooler weather and then back into the 50’s for the remainder of next week.  Lotsa’ Luck</p>\n",

That warm water on the upper West should help get the Hendricksons going in better numbers as we get into May.  You should see #18-20 Olives, #16-20 Blue Quills, #14-16 Hendricksons, #12-14 Quill Gordons and maybe some other larger bugs if you venture way down on the main.  We are also seeing some #18-20 Chimarra caddis and #14-16 Apple Caddis.  A good spent caddis pattern is always good if the fish get picky.

There are some small Chimarra caddis in the #18-20 range as well as Olives in the same size range and could be a factor if there aren’t the much bigger stoneflies around.  If the only dry have is a good stonefly imitation, a dark-bodied elk hair caddis, you’ll be fine.  The nymphing is going to be the way to go for most of the day with a variety of stoneflies and mayfly nymphs tied to get down in the heavy water.

The rivers are all still running on the high side with both reservoirs still spilling, with very clean water throughout.  The upper West at Stilesville is running 2510 cfs and 39 degrees while down at Hale Eddy we have 3000 cfs and 39 degrees.  The upper East Branch is running 1380 cfs at Harvard and down below the Beaverkill at Fishs’ Eddy we have 2780 cfs and 42 degrees.  The main Delaware at Lordville is running 5960 cfs and 44 degrees.  Overall these conditions are awesome, unless you’re looking to wade.  There are some fish coming up in the afternoons with #16-18 Stoneflies, #18-20 Chimarra caddis and some Olives in the #18-20 range. There’s plenty of water for streamers and if you have some cloud cover or low light it’s going to help with the water being so clear, sunny skies will be tough with them.  The upcoming air temps look good and no precipitation in the immediate forecast.  Lotsa’ Luck, , \n",

      "Water levels have dropped slightly over the last couple days with both reservoirs still spilling.  The water is very clear throughout the system despite the depth.  We’ve had pretty good bugs lately in the early afternoons on with black stoneflies making up the majority of the bugs on the water and are really the only dry fly you’ll need until the mayflies pick up later in the month.  This time of year the fish might not stay up long but if you get a good drift over them while they’re feeding they will eat.  The best dry fly window is going to be in the afternoons with the warmest temps, say from 2pm-7pm.  The upper West at Stilesville is running 1720 cfs and 39 degrees and down at Hale Eddy we have 2190 cfs and 40 degrees.  The upper East Branch at Harvard is running 1590 cfs and 41 degrees and down at Fishs’ Eddy the flow is 3280 cfs and 44 degrees.  The mainstem at Lordville is running 5650 cfs and 45 degrees.  Along with the stoneflies in size #14-20 there are lots of Chimarra caddis in #16-18.  You likely won’t see fish keying in on anything on top other than the stoneflies while they are still around in the current numbers.  The streamer fishing can be decent, especially if you get some good cloud cover.  With the super-clear water the streamer fishing is going to be tough if you have high sun, as it always will be.  It does look like a bit of rain tonight around 5pm and maybe a quarter inch on Thursday in the midday hours.  Lotsa’ Luck , , \n",

Cannonsville reservoir on the West Branch has been spilling for about a week and Pepacton just started to spill.  It’s been cold during the nights, keeping the water temps in around 40 degrees to start the days and on the warmer days we’ve had the temps have been getting into the mid-40’s.

All of the rivers are very clear despite the higher volumes they are running.  We’ve been seeing good stonefly activity in the afternoons, especially on the warmer days, with some fish poking their noses up on the warmer days.  A nice, dark-bodied elk hair caddis always works well for the fluttering stones in the #16-18 range.  Throwing streamers is always a good option to cover some water this time of year as well.  A good sink tip is nice to have with these flows.  Nymphing is also hard to beat, especially as the flows drop, with a variety of bugs.

The nymphing has been pretty consistent lately with and definitely the most consistent method of fishing at least until we get into the afternoons and typically find some rising fish.  For the bugs in the afternoons, look for small #18-22 Blue Winged Olives and their spinners-small rustys, #12 Isonychia and some #16-18 hebes down on the main and East Branch.

We had some decent bugs and rising fish yesterday on all of the rivers with small BWO’s being the most prevalent bug this time of year.  Small rusty spinners in the same size range, #18-24, are also great patterns any time of the day and are especially nice on fussy fish.  We’re still seeing the early-fall smattering of other bugs like #12 Isonychia, #16-18 hebes along with a few #14 summer Cahills.  Some of those bigger bugs are also great to blind-cast, gridding the water looking for an opportunistic fish.  They also support a dropper well if you don’t want to stare at an indicator.  It’s a nice time of year to get out and explore your favorite water.  It’s best not to get caught up on the lower flows, thinking that the fishing will suffer, there’s plenty of good fishing to be had and some great views as well.  Lotsa’ Luck , , \n",

      "Today we’re starting the week with mostly cloudy skies with a bit of rain moving in later today and temps peaking in the mid-70’s.  We got a bit of light rain yesterday afternoon which helped keep the water levels up.  Today we have very similar flows with pretty good temps throughout the system.  The upper West Branch at Stilesville is running 363 cfs and 51 degrees and down at Hale Eddy we have 516 cfs and 55 degrees.  The upper East Branch at Harvard is at 270 cfs and 56 degrees and down at Fishs’ Eddy we have 731 cfs and 60 degrees.  The main Delaware at Lordville is running 1520 cfs and 63 degrees.  With conditions remaining pretty consistent the last few days not much is going to change as far as fishing and the bugs unless we get some heavier rain and some color to the water.  Olives in #18-24 are going to be your best bet on most fish.  You can typically get away with an Olive in the #18-20 range.  Small winged ants in the same size range are hard to beat on a fish that’s consistently rising.  The bigger summer stenos and Isonychia are good for blind casting, especially if you’re moving in a boat.  Droppers off of those same bugs are good options too if you don’t want to run an indicator, which is also working well.  Streamers can be productive this time of year and will depend  a lot on the current conditions.  A bit of rain today and tomorrow would be perfect.  Lotsa’ Luck, , \n",

      "We’ve got some light rain moving though the area today, nothing significant but it should be a good day to stimulate the some Olives and make a decent day to be out on the water.  Water levels are pretty much the same as what we’ve had the last couple days and decent temperatures throughout the system.  The upper West Branch at Stilesville is running 363 cfs and 52 degrees and down at Hale Eddy we have 494 cfs and 56 degrees.  The upper East Branch at Harvard is running 266 cfs and 59 degrees and down below the Beaverkill at Fishs’ Eddy we have 731 cfs and 62 degrees.  The main Delaware at Lordville we have 1150 cfs and 65 degrees.  The bugs aren’t going to be changing too much any time soon with Blue Winged Olives in #18-24 being the most prevalent bug around and the most likely bug to find steadily rising fish eating.  We are a few other random some other bugs like summer stenos in #14-16, hebes in #16-18, #12 Isonychia and small winged ants in the #18-24 range.  Streamer fishing this time of year can be good, especially with the right conditions like low light, a little stain to the water etc.  It looks like a chance of rain the next two days, which is great and will help keep water levels up with the higher release levels a thing of the past with the current reservoir levels.

      "There’s pretty good fog covering the river this morning with clear skies and highs around 80 later this afternoon.  The water levels have continued to drop a bit and everything is running pretty clear at the moment.  The upper West at Stilesville is still at 363 cfs and 51 degrees and down at Hale Eddy we have 547 cfs and 54 degrees.  The upper East is running 333 cfs and 57 degrees and down at Fishs’ Eddy we have 1020 cfs and 60 degrees.  The main Delaware at Lordville is running 2050 cfs and 63 degrees.  Water temps are pretty good throughout the system so you should have some options to fish your favorite water.  The water on the West Branch is running a bit warmer than it’s usual release temps due to the reservoir levels getting lower after months of sucking the colder layers from the bottom.  We are still seeing the same bugs but the midday hatches have slowed due to the water temps.  If you find steadily rising fish it’s likely going to be eating small Blue Winged Olives or winged ants in the #18-24 range.  There has been some Tricos and their spinners in the mornings too, until the sun really comes out for the day.  Streamers are still an option but the water is getting pretty clear for any midday action.  Nymphing is going to be your best bet during the day and it’s been pretty good lately.  It looks like clouds and possible rain the next few days but nothing significant to change the river much.  Lotsa’ Luck, , \n",

      "This morning is starting out foggy and clear with temps in the 50’s with highs later in the mid-70’s and little cloud cover.  The rivers have shaped up and cleared after the rains we got mid-week which finally did get some much needed water into the system.  The upper West Branch at Stilesville is running 363 cfs and 51 degrees and down at Hale Eddy we have 645 cfs and 56 degrees.  The West Branch is running pretty clear, with a bit of stain still in the water from the release out of Cannonsville.  The East Branch finally got some water and currently at Harvard we have 470 cfs and 58 degrees.  The lower East Branch at Fishs’ Eddy we have 1520 cfs and 60 degrees.  The main Delaware at Lordville is running 2910 cfs and 63 degrees.  Now that the river has settled down from the rains we should continue to have some decent fishing with small Blue Winged Olives in #18-24 and their spinners.  There are plenty of small rusty spinners on the water this morning but are great flies any time of the day you find fish rising.  Most of the hatching will be from afternoon into evening.  We are still seeing a few scattered larger summer Cahills in the #14 range and smaller hebes in #16-18.  The nymphing has been solid for the last month or so with many options in the #12-18 size range.  Streamer fishing has been decent to very good lately, it just depends on the day and conditions.  It doesn’t look like too much rain in the immediate future so we should have some stable water for a while.  Lotsa’ Luck, , \n",

      "The rain has stopped after a pretty good rain the last 20 hours or so.  We finally did get some decent and much-needed rain for the system and most of the rivers have risen quite a bit but there is still some water on the upper West Branch.  This is the first decent rain that really brought the rivers up in several months.  Up at Stilesville on the upper West Branch we have 376 cfs, basically what it was flowing pre-rain, and 51 degrees.  Downriver at Hale Eddy we have 1440 cfs and dropping quickly and 60 degrees due to the warm rain water and runoff.  The East Branch and it’s tribs finally got some rain.  Harvard on the upper East is running 2160 cfs and 62 degrees and downriver at Fishs’ Eddy we have 3540 cfs and 62 degrees.  The main Delaware at Lordville is running 5360 cfs and 64 degrees and will be rising for a while.  As far as wadeable water the upper West Branch above Deposit is going the be the best bet.  There is some color to the river on the West bank from Cold Spring Creek that enters the river right above the Stilesville access point.  From there, several miles down, until you hit Oquaga creek on the West bank of the river it’s going to be fairly low and much clearer than below Oquaga.  As you move downriver towards Hale Eddy the water eventually mixes and is pretty stained at the moment but is dropping quickly and will be fished today for sure.  It does look like the vast majority of the storm is passed us but we may get some light rain throughout the day.  The East Branch and main is going to be running high with color for a while but it’s the best thing for those rivers and the reservoirs too.  Lotsa’ Luck, , \n",

      "We are finally getting a bit of rain this morning to start the week.  The storm is currently traveling just north of us and but the chance of rain looks like it will last for the next 24-30 hours, with a long line of rain heading our way.  Hopefully we get some rain out of the system as most of the storms the last few months bypassed us.  Today, and probably tomorrow depending on what rain actually hits us, should be good days to be out with light rain and currently there’s zero impact to the river from the rain overnight.  A perfect day for some BWO’s and possibly some streamer activity, especially if we start to get any color to the water.  The upper West at Stilesville is now running 363 cfs and 51 degrees and down at Hale Eddy we have 423 cfs and 53 degrees.  The upper East Branch at Harvard is running 132 cfs and 58 degrees and down at Fishs’ Eddy we have 205 cfs and 65 degrees.  The main Delaware at Lordville is running 899 cfs and 65 degrees.  With the good cloud cover and hopefully some decent rain we should have good Olives in #18-24, which typically start later in the afternoon and into evening.  The streamer fishing should also be a good option with the cloud cover and current heavy fog over the river and only get better if we’re lucky enough to get some rain.  Lotsa’ Luck, , \n",

      "Today is starting out with good cloud cover after a bit of light rain overnight and more on the way later today, around 4pm.  They did lower the release on the West Branch overnight as the rain helped the river meet the minimum flows downriver.  The current flow at Stilesville is 363 cfs and 50 degrees and down at Hale Eddy we have 404 cfs and 52 degrees.  The upper East Branch at Harvard is running 125 cfs and 58 degrees and down at Fishs’ Eddy we have 191 cfs and 64 degrees.  The main Delaware at Lordville is running 937 cfs and 62 degrees.  With the lower water we currently have on the West Branch you will be able to wade pretty much all of the river.  We’ve had great Olive hatches in the afternoons and fishing has been good on top but never easy.  Small comparaduns, emergers, cripples and spinners in the #18-22 range are bugs you want to have on you.  A few larger summer Cahills in #14-16, hebes in #16-18 and some winged ants in #18-24 have been around as well in varying numbers depending on the day.  If the rain coming in brings some stain to the water the streamer fishing could again be an option as well.  Lotsa’ Luck, , \n",

      "We’ve got some clouds this morning, which they are saying will stick around all day, and we’ve got lower water on the West than we’ve had in a few days of fluctuating water.  The fishing has been good, despite the water flows, especially for this time of year.  Although the water has been up and down lately, it’s remained between 650-1000 cfs, which is really good water to both wade fish and float.  The West Branch is flowing with stained water which is dirtier the higher up you go towards the dam and clears as you move downriver.  The upper West at Stilesville is running 649 cfs and 50 degrees and down at Hale Eddy we have 937 cfs and 50 degrees which will drop a few hundred cfs in the next few hours.  The upper East at Harvard is running 137 cfs and 56 degree and down at Fishs’ Eddy we have 208 cfs and 62 degrees.  The main Delaware at Lordville is running 1270 cfs and 60 degrees this morning.  We’ve been getting some good Olive hatches in the afternoons and into evening with some spinners mixed in as you move towards sunset.  If you find steadily rising fish chances are they will be eating small Olives.  We are seeing a few other bugs on the water, a few summer Cahills in #14, some hebes in #16-18 and #12 Isonychia - all of which are great blind-casting flies and the larger bugs are great for running a dropper.  With the stain to the water and fall approaching the streamer fishing has also picked up, especially early and late.  It’s looks like some rain moving in late Sunday, through Monday and into Tuesday - the best case scenario for some good fishing.  Lotsa’ Luck, , \n",

      "The river is running high going into the weekend despite the rain we got Tuesday night.  We got a good inch of rain but the water didn’t do much downriver to help meet the minimum flows down in NJ, so the high releases from Cannonsville continue.  The upper West Branch at Stilesville is running 919 cfs and 50 degrees and down at Hale Eddy we have 955 cfs and 50 degrees.  The West Branch is running with the usual fall stain from the release water which seemed to get a little dirtier after the rain.  The upper East Branch at Harvard is running 140 cfs and 55 degrees and down at Fishs’ Eddy we have 225 cfs and 62 degrees.  The main Delaware at Lordville is running 1520 cfs and 58 degrees.  We are still seeing good numbers of small Blue Winged Olives in the afternoons with plenty of fish looking up.  We are also getting a few Cahills in the #14-16 range, some hebes in #16-18 and a few #12 Isonychia as well.  Nymphing is also a solid method to get some fish any time of the day and with the turbidity in the river a nymph with some color and flash doesn’t hurt.  Streamer fishing is also a good option, especially early and late.  We will have pretty high water until we get some significant rain, more than a few inches.  Lotsa’ Luck.  , , \n",

      "Today we have partly cloudy skies with some rain moving in early this afternoon.  The flows are pretty much identical to yesterday, throughout the system, with the same lowering of the West Branch that we’ve had for over a week.  The fishing has been very good for late-August despite the yo-yoing of the flows lately.  The rain if supposed to start around 1pm and continue into the night with over an inch for the area.  As dry as it’s been an inch won’t do too much to the river, especially long term, but  will help meet the downstream minimum and help stabilize flows a bit.  We could have some decent streamer fishing later today and tomorrow if the rain ends up hitting us for a change.  Tomorrow looks like a good day to get out with most of the rain past us and good cloud cover.  We really need the rain in all of the local freestone streams and to help fill the reservoirs back up.

A few larger Cahills and hebes are around in #14-18 and some small winged-ants in #18-22 have been on the water and can be very prolific at times.

The water hasn’t started dropping here at Hale Eddy as appears they only decreased the flow a few hours ago.  The fishing has still been pretty good lately, even with the fluctuating water levels on the West Branch.  As for bugs there are a few Sulphurs way up on the West Branch but are overall pretty sporadic.  The #18-24 Blue Winged Olives have been the good lately and are a late-season staple for the next few months.  We are also seeing a few random Isonychia, Cahills and hebes in the afternoon hours.  Be on the lookout for the winged ants in #18-24 as they can be very important this time of year.  Nymphs like pheasant tails, frenchies, copper johns in sizes from 12-20 have been working very well under an indicator or fished as a dropper off a bigger dry.  Streamer fishing can also be good, mostly in low-light scenarios, in the morning  and evenings.

The powers to be likely thought we were going to get more rain in the system than what actually fell and raised the water back up once they realized it didn’t happen.  Hale Eddy is running 680 cfs and 49 degrees this morning and is rising to what will be over 900 cfs here in a few hours.

Small nymphs representing the Sulphurs and Olives are also working well.  Some #12 Isonychia and #14 Cahills are great flies to grid the water with and also work well to run a dropper off of.

Fishing should remain pretty steady with the tail end of the season’s #18-20 Sulphurs still coming off upriver, around Deposit, starting in the early afternoon.  Small Olives, from #20-24, are also bugs you’ll have to have, even on the bright and sunny days.  For some larger bugs the Isonychia in #10-12 and #14 Cahills are great choices still.  #18 Sulphur-specific or Pheasant tail nymphs are hard to be when nymphing or running as a dropper, pretty much all day.

      "This Friday morning is very clear with cooler temps to start the day, currently around 60 degrees with highs later today in the low-70’s.  Due to the dry conditions lately we have a some more release water on the West Branch to keep the water levels up way down river.  The upper West Branch at Stilesville is running 627 cfs and 47 degrees and down at Hale Eddy we have 625 cfs and 47 degrees.  Hale Eddy is going to rise a bit as that release water makes it’s way downriver.  The upper East Branch at Harvard is running 153 cfs and 57 degrees while the lower East Branch is running 232 cfs and 65 degrees.  The main Delaware at Lordville is running 907 cfs and 65 degrees.  We are still getting some Sulphurs up top on the West, up around Deposit, starting around noon with some nice fish looking up.  Running droppers and nymphing has also been very productive, both before and during the hatch.  There are a few Isonychia out there too, which always make great blind-casting bugs both with or without a dropper.  Don’t forget the small terrestrials either, ants and beetles are hard to be on fussy fish this time of year.  Lotsa’ Luck, , \n",

      "Today is looking pretty good to start, with good cloud cover and cooler temps with highs around 80 this afternoon.  There is a slight chance of some rain this afternoon, as there is most days this time of year but don’t expect much.  It’s been very dry lately and water flows are still very steady, where they’ve been for a few months.  The upper West Branch at Stilesville is running 496 cfs and 48 degrees and down at Hale Eddy we have 520 cfs and 50 degrees.  The upper East Branch at Harvard is now at 159 cfs and 64 degrees and down at Fishs’ Eddy we have 272 cfs and 72 degrees.  The main Delaware down at Lordville is running 972 cfs and 71 degrees.  As we move more into August the Sulphur hatch is still going strong, with plenty of fish feeding on top and eating the nymphs below as well.  The hatch has been starting around noon on most days with bugs going through the evening.  We should have some decent Blue Winged Olives mixed in too, especially with the cloud cover we’ve got.  The nymps, fished both with indicators or as a dropper, has been very effective as well.  Keep a few of your favorite terrestrials handy for tough fish as they are very effective this time of year.

      "We’ve got some cloud cover this morning, which is always welcomed versus high sun.  We did get another thermal release on the West Branch last night, with just under 700 cfs up at Stilesville before the cut it back to the 500 cfs we currently have up there.  Hale Eddy is still dropping with 587 currently and 50 degrees to start the day.  The upper East is running 156 cfs and 62 degrees up at Harvard and down at Fishs’ Eddy we have 254 cfs and 72 degrees.  The upper mainstem at Lordville is running 962 cfs and 70 degrees.  There isn’t a lot to report since we’ve had identical conditions and bugs over the last few weeks.  But, that’s good because for mid-August we have pretty good hatches of Sulphurs kicking off midday up around Deposit.  The fish are in their typical summer Sulphur mood and are about as picky as fish can get while eating dry flies.  You want to have some select Sulphur patterns in #18-20 along with some nymphs to use as droppers and spinners for the evenings.  Small Olives and terrestrials are oftentimes good flies to use during the Sulphur hatch and same goes for some small rusty spinners for the Olives.  A #22 Rusty Spinner is a common bug to be found on the water at any time of the day and the big, fussy fish know that.  It looks like warm weather, getting near 90 degrees, the next few days with a chance of storm in the afternoons.  From Tuesday on the highs are a bit cooler, below 80, which we will take.

The upper West Branch at Stilesville is running 568 cfs and 47 degrees while down at Hale Eddy we have 695 cfs and 48 degrees.   The river is currently up a bit and dropping due to a thermal release overnight.  The flow will be back down to the mid-500 cfs range in the next few hours here at Hale Eddy.  These frequent thermal releases haven’t negatively impacted fishing.  The upper East at Harvard is running 159 cfs and 60 degrees and down at Hale Eddy we have 275 cfs and 70 degrees.  The upper mainstem at Lordville is running 944 cfs and 69 degrees.  The upper West Branch, up around Deposit, has been the place to be with #18-20 Sulphurs picking up around noon.  Small Blue Winged Olives have been around as well, despite the weather, and are great flies to have.  There are a few winged ants around too in #20-24 and should increase in numbers as we get into August.  Terrestrials, in general, are great flies to have during these warm summer days.  There are also a few Isonychia and Cahills as well if you need a big blind-casting bug.

Around noon, give or take an hour, has been when a few Sulphurs start to show up.  You will want #18’s and #20’s in several of your favorite emerger patterns and maybe a few cripples and some spinners for the evening.  Small Olives, in #18-24, are essential to have as well, even on the bright and sunny days.  The fish oftentimes will take the small Olives, even during a decent Sulphur hatch.  Small rusty spinners for the Olives are also great flies for the picky fish.  Terrestrials are also good flies to try for the next month or so.  If you want to throw a bigger bug, possibly with a dropper there have been a few Isonychia in #12 as well as #14 Cahills.

We may get a few small showers but it looks like the rain has moved past us for the day leaving good cloud cover though, which does help.  The air temps the next few days are around 80 degrees, a nice change after several days in the 90’s.

We did have a pretty good thunderstorm last night around 6:30 pm, which brought fog afterwards, and didn’t help the evening hatch or the fishing.  Overall we’ve been getting pretty good Sulphurs on the upper stretches of the West Branch, typically starting to show around noon and going through the evening.  The #18-24 Blue Winged Olives could be pretty good today with the conditions.  We really haven’t had much cloud cover the last few weeks so it will definitely help.  We have also been getting some #10-12 Isonychia and #14 Cahills as well in the afternoons.

These summer conditions make for some tricky fish but we are lucky to have some midday targets.  Sparse and buggy cripples, emergers, droppers and spinners are must-have flies to throw at these fish.  If the fish seem to be feeding subsurface, ie. you see random body parts other than a mouth, small little pheasant tails or Sulphur nymphs work great as droppers.  6X tippet is going to be necessary and maybe even 7X if you trust yourself will also help get a better drift with the smaller flies.  The larger Isonychia and Cahills also make some decent bugs to cover water and run a dropper.  The weather and conditions look pretty similar all week, with little rain in the immediate forecast.

The upper West Branch at Stilesville is running 496 cfs and 46 degrees and down at Hale Eddy we have 611 cfs and 50 degrees.  The upper East Branch at Harvard is running 288 cfs and 60 degrees while down at Fishs’ Eddy we have 744 cfs and 64 degrees.  The mainstem down at Lordville is now running 1960 cfs and 67 degrees, too warm for trout fishing.  We can expect some Sulphurs in the #16-20 range later this afternoon and it also looks like a great BWO day with bugs in the #18-22 range.  There have been more Isonychia in #10-12 around lately throughout the system.  It does look like most of the rain has passed and we should have good cloud cover for the remainder of today and some tomorrow as well.  Lotsa’ Luck, , \n",

It looks like cloud cover moving in later today with rain starting around dark and continuing until tomorrow morning, with cooler air temps behind the front moving through.  A possible half inch of rain would be great for the river and fishing tomorrow, even if we do have a little stain to the water tomorrow.  It looks like they did bump the release out of Cannonsville last night for thermal reasons due to the high air temps today.  The upper West at Stilesville is just under 500 cfs and 57 degrees and down at Hale Eddy we have 685 cfs and 48 degrees, which will drop today as the thermal release passes.  The upper East Branch at Harvard is running 310 cfs and 57 degrees and down at Fishs’ Eddy we have 840 cfs and 60 degrees.  The main Delaware at Lordville is running 2170 cfs and 64 degrees.  Today is going to be a good day to be on the upper West Branch with the air temps.  We’ve been seeing some Sulphurs starting in the early afternoons in the #16-20 size range.  With the Sulphurs this time of year the fish can get pretty fussy and be aware of fish feeding just below the surface.  A good Sulphur nymph dropper behind a buoyant dry fly oftentimes works on these fish.  Blue Winged Olives in #18-22 are always a good choice, especially with the clouds and rain coming in.  #10-12 Isonychia are always good bugs to cover some water with, any time of the day.  If we do get some stain to the water we could have some decent streamer fishing the first half of tomorrow.  Lotsa’ Luck, , \n",

As the water was clearing yesterday we had some really good fishing, both some streamer opportunities and some great Sulphurs and dry fly fishing as well.  We are still seeing good Sulphurs in the #16-20 range, which are starting around 2-3pm on most days on the upper half of the West Branch.  We will see the Sulphurs for a few more months, with the small #18-20 Dortheas just getting started, mixed in with the larger ones.  Blue Winged Olives in #18-22 are must-have flies too from here on out.  Sometimes even during a great Sulphur hatch a small Olive will work better.  There are also some #10-12 Isonychia, which will be around for several months and are great blind-casting flies.  You could see #14 Grey Fox which are also a good, larger blind-casting bugs and will support a dropper if needed.

With good cloud cover all day and mild wind it looks like a very good day to be on the water.  We had pretty solid bugs and fishing yesterday with some Sulphurs typically starting around 2-3 pm and remaining strong in the later evening hours with plenty of fish eating on top.

The main Delaware at Lordville running 1560 cfs and 60 degrees.  The main bugs are the #16-20 Sulphurs mentioned above as well as #18-22 Blue Winged Olives which are always important this time of year.  There are also pretty good #10-12 Isonychia and a few #14 Grey Fox spread through the afternoons and are great blind-casting bugs, especially if your in a boat covering some water.  Nymphing has been good as well with the nymphs of the above bugs.  With the calm nights you should also have a decent selection of Rusty spinners for the Olives and Isos as well as a few Ginger spinners for the Sulpurs and Grey Fox.  Watch for the fish eating the Sulphurs too, if they seem to be eating subsurface, a dropper off the back of a realistic dry fly works very well.  The weather looks great the next few days with some rain moving in late-Wednesday and into Thursday, which always makes us and the fish happy.  Lotsa’ Luck, , \n",

We typically see the #14-18 Sulphurs start around 2-3pm and trickle off for the afternoon and some better bugs the last few hours of the day.  We are seeing a few #10-12 Isonychia and #14 Grey Fox as well.  Those bigger bugs are always favorites when blind-casting and work well to support a dropper if that’s your thing.

With the water dropping we should see a pickup in the surface activity with #14-20 Sulphurs, #18-22 Blue Winged Olives, #10-12 Isonychia and the spinners of the above bugs, typically in the evenings.  On the very warm mornings we have seen some decent activity lately for a few hours on top with leftover spinners, spent caddis or random terrestrials.

You can typically find some consistent targets on top, trash feeding on leftover bugs and spinners from the previous day.  Good morning flies are small spinners, ginger or rusty this time of year, or maybe a small spent-caddis or terrestrial as the temps warm.  Ants and beetles are always good morning flies.  As far as bugs in the afternoons, #14-18 Sulphurs are typically starting between 2-3pm, #18-22 Blue Winged Olives, #10-12 Isonychia sporadicly and maybe a #14 Grey Fox or two.

It looks like great fishing weather and should be a great day for bugs as well.  Flows have dropped slowly the last few days with 1970 cfs up at Stilesville and 46 degrees.  Downriver at Hale Eddy the flow is 2530 cfs and 44 degrees.  The West currently has a bit of color but is overall pretty clear.  The upper East at Harvard is running 1870 cfs and 45 degrees and down below the Beaverkill at Fishs’ Eddy we have 2940 cfs and 47 degrees.  The main Delaware down at Lordville is running 6620 cfs and 49 degrees.  The rivers are still running high, typical this time of year, but conditions are ideal to be in a boat and fishing is starting to pick up with good bugs in the afternoons.  You’re likely to see #16-18 Blue Quills, #18-20 Blue Winged Olives, #12-14 Quill Gordons, #14-16 Hendricksons, #18-20 Little Black Stones and #18-20 Chimarra caddis.  Rusty spinners in size #14-20 are also essential bugs this time of year and are great flies if fish are being fussy. Nymphing has been good too with a variety of flies to represent the above bugs.  Streamer fishing has still been working and if we get some stain to the water all the better.  Lotsa’ Luck., , \n",

With the higher water streamer or nymph fishing has been the method to start the day and hopefully as we get into the afternoon hours we start to see some fish on top.  The fish have just started to look up and we are seeing decent numbers of, depending on the day and weather, all the usual bugs for late April.  You can expect to see #16-18 Blue Quills, #18-20 Blue Winged Olives, #12-14 Quill Gordons, #14-16 Hendricksons, #18-20 Chimarra caddis and maybe some #16-20 Black Stoneflies.  Lotsa’ Luck, , \n",

The upper West Branch at Stilesville is now running 2420 cfs and 42 degrees and down at Hale Eddy we have 2830 cfs and 42 degrees, with a slight stain to the water from the snow runoff into the tribs.

The main Delaware down at Lordville is running 6650 cfs and 44 degrees, down a few thousand since yesterday.  The bugs should be good the next few days with warm air temps until mid-week.  This will be the week where there’s some good, early-season dry fly fishing before it gets very busy on the water for a couple months.  We are going to see the same bugs for a while with #16-18 Blue Quills, #18-20 Blue Winged Olives, #12-14 Quill Gordons, #14-16 Hendricksons and #18-20 Chimarra caddis.  Mid-day is your best bet for rising fish and spinners of the mayflies above, which will all be rusty spinners of the appropriate size.

The rivers are still dropping at a steady rate, along with the reservoirs, but it does look like more rain tonight and through tomorrow.  There is also some snow mixed in during morning hours, followed by more rain throughout the day which is going to keep those reservoirs spilling for a while.  Very typical weather for this time of year in the Catskills.  The upper West Branch at Stilesville is running  1560 cfs and 40 degrees and down at Hale Eddy we have 2070 cfs and 49 degrees.

We did have some colder weather with a bit of snow this past weekend and those that fished did pretty well for mid-April.  Most fish were taken on streamers and nymphs with the higher cold water.  There have been a few bugs around with the usual suspects; #16-20 little black Stoneflies, #18-22 Blue Winged Olives, #12-14 Quill Gordons and #14-16 Hendricksons.  If you’re looking for water to wade, the Beaverkill and Willowemoc, or other freestones, are your best bet and are a week or so ahead of the tailwaters as far as temps and bugs activity.

The rain yesterday was spread out and didn’t do much to the still-dropping rivers.  Those who dealt with the weather yesterday and put in some effort did very well.  This time of year, and really all year, if you get scared off with a little colder weather and rain you will  always miss out on the best days of fishing.  The rivers and reservoirs are still dropping slowly with no rain until tomorrow evening and into Tuesday.  The upper West Branch at Stilesville is running 1800 cfs and 40 degrees.

The best bet for wading is over on the Beaverkill or Willowemoc.  Streamers and nymphs have still been the best bet in the higher, cold water.  We are entering that time period where we are going to start seeing more bugs on the water and the fish on top will follow.  As far as hatches go it’s a very typical year with some Baetis and stoneflies around with a few Blue Quills, Quill Gordons and even Hendricksons showing up as we move towards the end of April.

The rivers have been slowly dropping as well as the amount of water coming over the reservoirs and everything is running pretty clear as of this morning.  With no real wading opportunities on the Delaware system some of the freestones East of here, like the Beaverkill (710 cfs), are going to be your best bet iif you’re looking to wade.

With the high water and the bugs and dry fly fishing just getting started we are still throwing a lot of streamers.  The streamer fishing can still be tough at times with colder water temps, an abundance of natural alewyves, and fish with full bellies.  We are seeing more bugs as time goes on with Black Stoneflies, Blue Winged Olives and a few Hendricksons starting to show up.

The weather this week also looks good with a bit of light rain mid week but temps in the upper-60’ and even 70’s a few days.  The rivers are still pretty high from the big storm that hit late last week but the rivers are all clearing up nicely and dropping quickly.  The tailwaters (East and West Branches) are going to drop slower due to the water coming over the dams from the reservoirs.  Anglers will be fishing today from boats and will do very well.  Almost entirely with streamers at these water levels, very common for this time of year.  Wading on the tailwaters will take some time so the Beaverkill (currently 1560 cfs) is going to be one of the first local rivers that allows some wading.

The rivers all did crest overnight an have dropped quite a bit after they crested.  If we can squeak by today without significant rains we should be in good shape as far as severe flooding goes.  The forecast looks clear for the most part this upcoming week with light rain later in the week which will allow the rivers to recede a bit and clear up.  Stilesville on the upper West Branch is now running 8,730 cfs and 39 degrees and down at Hale Eddy we have 10,300 cfs and 39 as well.

Once the river clears in a few days we should have some excellent streamer fishing in high water.  With the reservoir at 105.4% and rising there are going to be some baitfish to keep the fish fat and happy for a while.

We’re currently looking at very high water throughout the system and are running dirty at the moment.  How quickly they clear will depend on future rain.  As far as dropping, the tailwaters are not going to drop significantly any time soon with the high volume of water coming into the back side of the reservoirs.  They will actually continue to rise over the next few days despite any future precipitation.  They could clear and offer some good fishing from a boat very soon if we don’t get blasted again in the next few days.  As far as wade fishing, typical this time of year, it’s going to be a while.

There is a bit of color to the water but for early April the conditions are perfect with both reservoirs spilling.  With the short-term forecast this week, calling for a rainy week, they will be spilling for a some time with wading conditions on the Delaware non-existent for a while.

Over the past few weeks we’ve had some decent weather mixed in and the fishing has been very good for early spring with plenty of healthy fish, which have benefitted from the high water.  Streamer fishing from a drift boat has been the go-to method to cover water lately with a wide variety of colors and styles working lately.  A good sink tip line on a 6 or 7wt is your best bet, allowing you to get down and fish some lighter flies too.  We have been seeing some small #16-22 Black Stoneflies in the afternoons for a few weeks now, with a few fish coming up in the slower water if you’re lucky.  If you do find some fish on top it’s important to get on them quick as they don’t rise too many times this time of year.  Typically they’ll eat two or three times and stay down for a while.  If you do see any mayflies they’re going to be small Baetis, or Blue Winged Olives, in the #20-24 range.  We should start seeing some Blue Quills and Quill Gordons towards the middle of the month.

      "We’ve got some pretty heavy fog this morning along the river with temps in the 50’s to start the day and low-70’s for the high later today.  This is the first day in a few weeks where the water actually changed a much other than the frequent rain storms we’ve been getting.  They did lower the flow coming out of the reservoir on the West Branch overnight due to the reservoir getting a bit lower.  The upper West at Stilesville is running 1180 cfs and 61 degrees and down at Hale Eddy we’ve got 1550 cfs and 56 degrees.  At these levels you will finally be able to get around a bit better, especially upriver around Stilesville and Deposit in the no-kill area.  The East is still running relatively high with the flow up at Fishs’ Eddy being 2050 cfs and 54 degrees.  The main Delaware at Lordville is now at 4100 cfs and 59 degrees.  With fall moving in we’ve had pretty good fishing this week with a decent streamer bite, especially in the stained water of the West Branch which can be very effective early in the morning before the sun really comes out.  There have also been some consistent Blue Winged Olives in the #18-22 range in the afternoons and the lower water should be better for rising fish to come up through.  There have still been a few late season Isonychia in the #10-12 range and are ideal bugs to blind cast with or without a dropper.  Nymphing has also been pretty hot with small pheasant tails, Isonychia nymphs and a variety of smaller bugs in the #14-18 range.  It looks like good cloud cover and a drop in temps for the upcoming weekend with temps peaking in the low-60’s and thankfully no rain.  Lotsa’ Luck, , \n",

There are also some sporadic Isonychia in the #10-12 range and are great dries to blind cast and run a dropper off of.

Yesterday the river down at Lordville peaked at 67 degrees which isn’t bad for late August.  You should be able to find some rising fish in the afternoons and into the evenings.  The bugs which you’ll find them eating lately have been very small Blue Winged Olvies or possibly midges.  Small winged ants in the #20-22 range are also very hard to beat, despite what they may be eating.  Some fish may be eating the nymphs coming up through the water column and small droppers like pheasant tails or soft hackles are hard to beat.  It does look like we will be on the northern edge of the remains of the hurricane moving through the area tomorrow afternoon which should bring light rain to the area starting around 11am for the remainder of the day.  The light rain should be good for the water and Blue Winged Olives and if we get some stain to the water we could have some good streamer opportunities.  Lotsa’ Luck, , \n",

With the dropping water, great level of clarity (a bit of stain) and cooler temps this should be a great day to be on the water.  With the current conditions you should be able to do whatever type of fishing you like, whether on top or below the surface.  Small #18-20 Blue Winged Olives have been the most important dry flies for the last month or so and that won’t change anytime soon.  Also, a good winged ant pattern in the #18-22 range is likely just as good or better than the small Olives.  There are still some sporadic Isonychia as well and are great while moving in a boat, blind-cast in the faster moving water.  The Isos also make great flies to run a small dropper, like a pheasant tail, off of.  Nymphing has been solid too but yesterday was a bit tough with a good amount of displaced algae from the rain we got late Friday into Saturday.

The West Branch is going to be the best bet for today with clear and low water up at Stilesville, below the dam, and you’ll have several miles of cleaner water until you get below some of the feeder streams that are pumping in mud.

We did have a tremendous amount of winged ants on the West Branch yesterday in the #18-22 range and the fishing was as good.  The fish can be pretty selective on the size of these bugs and dealing with a ton of naturals on the water at the same time can be a problem too.  The water is also in pretty good shape to throw some light weight streamers on a floating line which is going to work a lot better in the lower light portions of the day.

Wading is still going to be very tough for a while, until the releases from the reservoirs is decreased, but fishing from a boat has been very good.  We are still getting our usual #16-20 Sulphurs, starting mid day, along with their spinners on calm nights.  With the cloud cover the BWO’s should be good today as well as a few Isonychia.  The water is in good shape for throwing streamers and with the clarity of the water sparse and smaller flies will work better.

We are getting pretty good Sulphurs in the #16-20 range, typically starting mid-day.  Small Olives are also great flies to have and terrestrials like ants and beetles are hard to beat this time of year despite what’s hatching.  Isonychia are also great flies to cover water with, and work really well to support a dropper if you like.

Small Olives in the #18-22 range are around, especially if we get some cloud cover.  We are also seeing a few Isonychia in the #10-12 range which are typically sporadic but make great blind casting flies and are excellent for running a dropper too.  There are always a few caddis around and spent caddis patterns work great on fish which are trash feeing, especially if you find them rising early in the day.

The Sulphurs we’re seeing now are the bigger #16’s with their spinners the last hour or so tonight.  We may have some cloud cover today and a few small Olives are always good to have for the fish rising, oftentimes trash feeding on whatever random bugs float by.  Small rusty spinners and spent caddis are great patterns for those fish.  Nymphing is going to be a solid option if no bugs are present.

It doesn’t look like much accumulation with the rain moving in later and hopefully the reservoir stays where it is and doesn’t spill which would also cause an increase in release.

Yesterday fished very well throughout the system as the water was dropping, which is usually the case.  There were great bugs with Hendricksons, Blue Quills, Olives, March Browns and lots of caddis.  Rusty spinners fell in the evening with the warmer weather and tonight should be no different. Throwing streamers is still an option in the higher water but everything is running very clear and once the sun really comes out the streamer fishing becomes much more difficult.

This week fished very well despite the cooler air and water temps, mainly due to the crumby/rainy weather which always fishes better than bright sun despite the air temp.  We are seeing lots of little Olives in the #18-22 range and the fish were readily taking duns and emergers if presented properly.  We are seeing some small caddis as well and the Hendricksons should really pick up over the next week and will be a key bug to have for a few weeks in the #14-16 size as well.  We should start seeing more Paraleps/Blue Quills in the #16-18 range which will also be a staple the next couple weeks.  Be on the lookout for Rusty spinners of the above bugs which will likely come off mid day this time of year.  Lotsa’ Luck, , \n",

With the lower water the nymphing is going to be more productive and the good runs will be more obvious.  Small black stoneflies in the #14-20 range, Copper Johns and pheasant tails are good flies this time of year.  We have been seeing some Black Stoneflies #14-20 and #20-24 Blue Winged Olives in the afternoon hours with the warmest water temps.

With most of the fishing being done now will be wade fishing with the water levels and all rivers are wadeable and are good as far as water temps go.  The small Blue Winged Olives are going to be your best bet for any fish that are rising consistently with a few Isonychia around as well.  Terrestrials, like ants and beetles, are always good bugs to have in the early fall.  Streamer fishing can be productive in the deeper water, especially during the low light hours of morning and evening.  It doesn’t look like much rain this week so our best bet for more water in the West would be dry conditions which lead to lower flows downriver.  Lotsa’ Luck, , \n",

The release will likely stay where it’s at unless dry conditions lead to lower water flows downriver.  The current flow at Stilesville on the upper West Branch is at 184 cfs and 51 degrees while downriver at Hale Eddy we have 220 cfs and 55 degrees.

The main Delaware at Lordville is running 1050 cfs and 57 degrees.  The West Branch does have a decent stain to it still to it so some streamer fishing is always an option and mornings are hard to beat for them.  The Blue Winged Olives are still around in size #18-22 and will be the most prevalent bug for the rest of the season.  We are also seeing a few Isonychia in the afternoons and they always make great blind casting flies or are great to run droppers off of.  We are seeing a few winged ants still in the #20-24 range, especially on the lower half of the West and mainstem.

Tomorrow looks like rain most of the day and into Wednesday which is much needed and will likely offer some great fishing for those who are out.  The current forecast is calling for around two inches spread out over the two days which is really the best case scenario.

We are seeing some winged ants in size #18-24, which are usually a little more common on the lower half of the West Branch.

Early morning streamer fishing is a good bet if you’re and early riser but once the sun really comes out it is generally a waste of time.

The upper East Branch at Harvard is running 209 cfs and 57 degrees and down at Fishs’ Eddy we are looking at 457 cfs and 63 degrees.  The main Delaware at Lordville is running 1170 cfs and 64 degrees.  The water temps are in pretty good shape thanks to the cool nights we’ve been having the last week.  We are still getting a few Sulphurs up around Deposit and Blue Winged Olives in the #18-22 range as well.  The nymphing has been pretty good, especially when there aren’t many bugs to choose from on top.  Pheasant tails, Isonychia nymphs and caddis pupa are good choices.  Mornings are a good time to get on the water this time of year with very few anglers out early.  There have been some Tricos on the East and a few on the lower West most mornings.  If you get up at the crack of daylight streamers are always a good option as well.  Lotsa’ Luck, , \n",

      "We’ve got a sunny but cool morning today with temps around 60 degrees with even cooler temps coming up the next couple nights.  These cooler temps really help keep the water temps cooler and will help the main and East Branch get back into shape.  The water is still looking good with that extra water from Cannonsville into the West Branch which also helps keep water temps down and is better for daylight bug activity.  The upper West at Stilesville is running 550 cfs and 48 degrees while down at Hale Eddy we are looking at 668 cfs and 52 degrees.  Harvard on the upper East is running 266 cfs and 58 degrees and down at Fishs’ Eddy we have 677 cfs and  64 degrees.  The main Delaware at Lordville is running 1450 cfs and 64 degrees as well.  There have been some Tricos in the #20-24 range on the East and lower West in the mornings and it’s also a good time to streamer fish and nymph if you’re an early riser.  The tail end of the Sulphur hatch is winding down on the upper West with some bugs typically popping around noon or so.  Isonychia and Cahills are still around, throughout the system with the random bug popping here and there but no real consistent hatch of them.  Nymphing and swinging wets is always a good way to cover water as well.  The weather this week looks great with highs in the 70’s and nights/mornings in the upper-40’s to low-50’s.

We’ve also got some decent cloud cover today with a slight chance of rain, which is great fishing weather with highs in the mid-70’s.  The upper West Branch at Stilesville is running 550 cfs and 47 degrees.  Downriver at Hale Eddy we are looking at 656 cfs adn 51 degrees with good clarity throughout the river.

It looks like good weather all week with cooler temps in the 70’s and some off and on cloud cover.  With the warm summer we’ve been having the cooler weather should help the lower half of the West and East Branch.  With the cooler water temps there’s a better chance of some daytime bug activity on these sections versus right at dark or in the middle of the night.  We are still seeing a few Sulphurs up around Deposit but that hatch is winding up as usual this time of year.  Blue Winged Olives will are always good bugs to have and become more important as we move towards fall.  Isonychia are also gonna be around for another month or more.  Streamer fishing, especially early or in low light situations, can be very productive too.  There are a few Tricos on the lower West or over on the East Branch too.

It’s been pretty dry lately with pretty steady flows the last month or so and a bit of rain is a welcomed sight.  The air temps the last few days have been pretty warm so the rain mixed with slightly cooler temps can’t hurt.  We have 542 cfs and 47 degrees upriver at Stilesville and down at Hale Eddy we have 571 cfs and 51 degrees.  The upper East Branch at Harvard is running 165 cfs and 65 degrees while down at Fishs’ Eddy we are looking at 348 cfs and 74 degrees.  The main Delaware at Lordville is running 1010 cfs and 72 degrees.  For the last several weeks the West Branch has been the place to find cold water and the upper West is the place to be with a decent Sulphur hatch starting in the early afternoon.  We have been seeing pretty good Sulphurs in the #18-20 range from Stilesville and through the no-kill section below Deposit starting around noon.  Droppers and emergers are the key during this tough hatch as well as long leaders and drag-free drifts.  We are seeing the usual #10-12 Isonychia and #14 Cahills as well throughout the whole West Branch, typically in the afternoons/evenings too.  Ants and beetles are always great flies this time of year, especially on the picky fish, even during a good Sulphur hatch.  It looks like the rain tonight will drop over an inch into tomorrow and the more the merrier as we’ve got no significant rain in over a month.  A little bump in the water will also help clear out some of the algae on the upper West Branch as well.   Lotsa’ Luck, , \n",

      "This Monday morning is starting out sunny and warm with temps this afternoon around 90 degrees with a chance of rain later in the day, around 7pm.  They have kept the release out of Cannonsville up over the last 24 hours which does help during these warmer days.  The upper West at Stilesville is running 621 cfs and 47 degrees and downriver at Hale Eddy we have 726 cfs and 48 degrees.  The upper East Branch at Harvard is running 170 cfs and 62 degrees while down at Fishs’ Eddy we have 319 cfs and 72 degrees.  The main Delaware down at Lordville is running 1160 cfs and 69 degrees this morning.  We won’t have a change in bugs for a while, which is ok, as we starting to get pretty good numbers of the small Sulphurs #18-20 up around the Deposit area from around noon on.  This is a notoriously tough hatch and many of the fish feeding are doing so right below the surface of the water and various droppers, like small pheasant tails or soft hackles, work very well.  Don’t forget the terrestrials too, even durning a good Sulphur hatch.  Blind casting Isonychia in the riffles is also a good tactic for the next few months.  With the temps all week being similar there is also a good chance of an afternoon shower as well and we’ll take all the rain we can get.  Lotsa’ Luck, , \n",

      "The hot and sunny days of summer continue with temps for the next few days in the 80’s and not much rain in the forecast aside from maybe a random afternoon thunderstorm which won’t do much to the river.  They’ve been pulsing the water from Cannonsville at night to cool the downriver sections a bit and the last two days we’ve they’ve given us about 100 cfs extra durning the day as well.  The flow up at Stilesville is running 621 cfs and 46 degrees and down at Hale Eddy we have 726 cfs and 49 degrees.  The upper East Branch at Harvard is running 170 cfs and 61 degrees and down at Fishs’ Eddy we have 352 cfs and 71 degrees.  The main at Lordville is running 1140 cfs and 70 degrees to start the day.  The West Branch is going to be  the only game in town for the foreseeable future until we get much cooler air temps.  The extra water in the West doesn’t hurt and mid-700’s is a good level for boaters and waders as well.  Not much is going to change on the bugs either for a while with the mid-day Sulphurs up around Deposit being the most significant hatch for a few months, typically starting around noon.  We are getting spinners too around dark with some other bugs mixed in randomly throughout the day.  Having  a few Isonychia or Cahills is always good and are nice sized flies to run droppers or blind cast in the faster water.  Nymphing is always an option and there is definitely less algae on the lower half of the West versus up top around Deposit.  Lotsa’ Luck, , \n",

They have ramped up the release at night out of Cannonsville to keep the downstream temps a bit lower but by mid-morning the levels are back to where they have been for the last several weeks.  The morning flows on the West are a bit high but will drop down into the mid-500 cfs range later this morning.

The upper East at Harvard is running 176 cfs and 62 degrees and down at Fishs’ Eddy we are looking at 393 cfs and 70 degrees.  The main Delaware at Lordville is running 1270 cfs and 70 degrees.  The mornings are a good time to hit the river without many other anglers and you can often find a few fish rising eating leftover spinners or small caddis.  We are seeing some decent Sulphur activity upriver starting around noon, give or take an hour, depending on the weather.  Be sure to have a good selection of #18 Sulphurs in different patterns of emergers and droppers.  We are getting some Isonychia on the river as well in size #10-12 and a few #14 Cahills.  Small Blue Winged Olives in the #18-22 range are always good to have as well.

The upper West Branch at Stilesville is now running 542 cfs and 46 degrees and down at Hale Eddy we are looking at 580 cfs and 50 degrees.

The main Delaware at Lordville is running 1360 cfs and 66 degrees to start the day.  We have steadily been seeing more of the small, #18-20 Sulphurs, show up mid-day around 12-1pm on the upper West Branch.  It’s one of our better hatches and is very consistent once it gets going so we should continue to see them for quite some time.   Small #18-22 Blue Winged Olives are always good flies to have for the rest of the summer as well and oftentimes work better than the Sulphurs during a Sulphur hatch.  We are still seeing a few #14-16 Cahills and #10-12 Isonychia throughout the system as well.

Today we should expect some Sulphurs in the #16-18 range and maybe some spinners this evening.  It’s a perfect Blue Winged Olive day as well and look for them in #18-22 and small rusty spinners are always hard to beat.  There have been some Isonychia as well in the #10-12 range and are good flies to have over the next few months.

We are getting some of the #14-16 Sulphurs with a few #18’s mixed in as well.  Have some Sulphur spinners for these warm nights at dark.  Nymphing  during the day with #14-18 Pheasant tails and Sulphur nymphs will get some fish as you deal with some algae as we haven’t had a flushing flow in quite some time.  Blind casting Isonychia in #10-12 or a  #14 Cahill is also a way to cover some of the moving water, especailly from a boat.  On these very warm days it is a good time to get out early in the morning and oftentimes there are a few leftover spinner or small caddis on the water before the temps warm up.  Lotsa’ Luck, , \n",

Nymphing with Sulphur-specific nymphs or small pheasant tails does work if nothing is happening hatch wise.  Blind casting Isonychia in the moving water is always a good way to drum some fish up as well.

We have also been seeing a lot of caddis and the picky fish seem to like a small, #18 or #20, spent caddis any time of the day.  Spent caddis and small rusty spinners are hard to beat for mid-day dries.  The nymphing has been pretty consistent too with the lower water with Pheasant Tails, Hare’s Ear’s and March Brown nymphs.  Swinging small soft hackles in the riffles is also a good game plan if you aren’t seeing much on the surface.   It looks like by the weekend we will be back down in temp with highs in the 60’s.

The West is still pretty stained and the East is still low and very clear.  The main is a good place to get some easy wading in and a bit clearer water.  We have still been getting some Blue Winged Olives, Caddis and a few Isonychia in the afternoons on all the rivers.  It looks like we will get around an inch of rain on Wednesday and some light rain most of the day on Thursday which will more than likely cause them to cut the water release back on the West and give us a bit more wading opportunity.  Remember, tomorrow the 15th will be the last day to fish the West Branch from the PA border up to the dam until next April.  The rest of the water downriver is open year round to catch and release.

The West is still wadeable at these levels but there is some debris in the water from the level raising this morning.  The East Branch is going to be a good place to be with clear water and very wadeable conditions.  The main will be much easier to wade as well and the extra water will take a while to get down there, especially if you’re going lower on the main.  Lotsa’ Luck, , \n",

The upper East Branch at Harvard is running 120 cfs and 50 degrees while down at Fishs’ Eddy we have 336 cfs and 52 degrees - up a bit from the Beaverkill after the rains on Monday.  The main Delaware at Lordville is currenlty running 1180 cfs and 55 degrees.  The West Branch is still running with some stain to the water coming out of the reservoir but it does look better with the lower water and is highly wadeable wherever you may go.  Nymphing and streamer fishing have been pretty good lately and typically some Blue Winged Olives, Isonychia and small #16-18 Dark Caddis in the afternoons into the evening and a few fish looking up.  The East also is fishing pretty well even though it’s fairly low and very clear.  The upper mainstem is very wadeable too with the same bugs and is clearer than the West once you get below the confluence and does clear more as you travel down river.  The weather this weekend into next week are cooling a bit with mid-30’s at night and 50’s-60’s for the high, without much rain but it does look like good cloud cover this Saturday.

The West Branch is in good shape and looks good this morning and is finally wadeable throughout the river.  They have cut the release from Cannonsville back quite a bit and the flow up at Stilesville is currently 221 cfs and 58 degrees while down at Hale Eddy we have 621 cfs and 56 degrees.  The East Branch did bump up a bit but is very fishable with 219 cfs up at Harvard and 767 cfs and 55 degrees down at Fishs’ Eddy.  The main Delaware at Lordville is running 1270 cfs and 56 degrees.  We’ll have to see how long they keep the flow down on the West Branch because downriver at Montegue, NJ the flow is very low, around 1,400 cfs which is well below the minimum they try to meet.  It wouldn’t be surprising if they started to raise the release on the West soon.  They are calling for clouds today so we could see some Olives in the afternoon hours.  With the lower water the nymphing should be good as well.  Although the water is lower it’s still fairly stained so the streamer fishing should remain a good option.  Lotsa’ Luck, , \n",

We really do need the water as we haven’t had a significant rain in a long time.  They’ve, as expected, kept tapering off the release from Cannonsville to start to conserve some water in the reservoir.  Temps the next few days seem pretty mild, in the mid-60’s, with no more rain this week once this storm passes.

The West Branch is still running pretty stained from the release and we can expect some more color to show up as the rain starts to raise the feeder creeks which flow into the river.  We should have some good streamer fishing if you get out today.  If the rain isn’t too heavy we could have some surface activity in the afternoon hours with small, #18-22 Blue Winged Olives and maybe a few #12 Isonychia here and there.

The main down at Lordville is running 1270 cfs and 62 degrees and is a great place to fish the next month.  The bugs are still the same listed below with BWO’s #18-22, hebes #16-18 and Isonychia #12 as well as a few winged ants in the#18-26 range.  We are seeing some spinners on most nights as it’s been pretty nice lately without any rain or any significance the last few weeks.  The weather looks to be pretty similar to what we’ve had lately with highs in the 70’s and cool nights.  Wednesday and Thursday look to be a bit warmer overnight due to cloud cover and some chance of light rain both days.  Lotsa’ Luck, , \n",

      "This Sunday morning is pretty cool, in the mid-50’s, with some decent cloud cover which is supposed to stick around all day.  We did get an increase in the release to the West Branch from Cannonsville reservoir, bringing the West Branch up to 889 cfs and 51degrees.  Down at Hale Eddy we have 951 cfs and 51 degrees.  The water is still has the same stain as we’ve had for the last few weeks but it may appear dirtier just due to the volume of water in the river now but it’s definitely clear enough for all types of fishing and should really help with the streamer bite.  The upper East Branch at Harvard is running 167 cfs and 52 degrees while down at Fishs’ Eddy we are looking at 199 cfs and 59 degrees.   The mainstem down at Lordville is running 818 cfs and 60 degrees this morning and the extra water we’ve got hasn’t made its way down there yet, at least according to the gauge which isn’t real time.  With the cooler temps everything is currently fishable and the upper main has been a good spot to be lately as the fish haven’t had too much pressure lately.  We are still seeing the same bugs throughout the system on the different branches with a typical Olive hatch in the afternoons/evenings.  We are also seeing the Isonychia in #12 and some hebes in the #16-18 range along with the spinners on most evenings, typically the last few hours before dark.  We are seeing a few of the winged ants in size #18-26 which are always good fall flies and the fish will definitely target them.  With the increased water and stain we’ve got on the West Branch we should have some good streamer fishing coming up and the fall is an excellent time with the browns starting to think about the upcoming spawn which usually means more aggressive fish.

You’ll see a few hebes and Isonychia too which are always dependable early-fall hatches.  Small winged-ants are also good bugs in the #18-26 range.

We are also seeing some #12 Isonychia and they continue to be a great blind-casting fly and are also great for running a dropper off the back and gridding the riffles.  A few hebes have also been around and spinners in the evenings if it’s not too windy or rainy.  We are seeing some small #18-26 winged ants which are an amber or cinnamon color and the fish will definitely key in on them.

Today looks to be the warmest of the week and then temps start to drop again into the low-50’s at night and low-70’s during the day.  The rivers puffed up a bit yesterday and some areas got a little dirty but the rain was over before noon and water levels and clarity are currently pretty good.  The upper West Branch at Stilesville is still running 391 cfs and 51 degrees while down at Hale Eddy we have 637 cfs and 53 with your typical late summer stain from the release and maybe a bit more below your larger feeder streams entering the river.

The main Delaware is running 1110 cfs and 63 degrees this morning.  With some decent cloud cover this morning which is supposed to clear as the day goes on we could have some decent fishing today.  The streamer fishing could be good due to the stain we have going on which won’t entirely clear due to the release water having a good tint to it coming out of the reservoir.  We should see some Blue Winged Olives today, which have been pretty good lately from afternoon on till the evening.  There are also so Isonychia #12 that will be around for the next month and are always great flies this time of year.  We should also have the hebes in #16-18 for the next few weeks along with their spinners on decent nights which are also very important late season bugs.

They were calling for over an inch with rain most of the day but it does look like the rain will pass soon, within the hour, with maybe a bit later today but nowhere near an inch.  The flows are actually down slightly due to the decrease in the release from Cannonsville into the West Branch over the last couple days, likely in anticipation of this storm which will help meet downstream flows that are getting pretty low.  The upper West Branch at Stilesville is running 391 cfs and 51 degrees and down at Hale Eddy we are looking at 570 cfs and 53 this morning.  The upper East Branch at Harvard is running 173 cfs and 54 degrees while down at Fishs’ Eddy we have 208 cfs and 61 degrees.  The main Delaware at Lordville is running 844 cfs and 61 degrees.  With these rains we can expect the rivers to start to rise soon and get some more color - a great day for throwing streamers, especially if you have access to a boat.  It would be highly unlikely that today wouldn’t be very good day throwing streamers as we haven’t had much change to the 500-700 cfs flow in several months and no decently stained water either.  We could see some bugs later this afternoon and it could be a good Olive day if some light rain/cloud cover sticks around and it doesn’t get too dirty.

The upper West Branch at Stilesville is running 417 cfs and 51 degrees and down at Hale Eddy we have 611 cfs and 51 degrees as well.

The main Delaware down at Lordville is running 1060 cfs and 61 degrees.  Today should be a great day on the water with good fishing throughout the system due to the cooler nights and lower daytime temps as well.  The nymphing has been pretty good lately with a variety of bugs in the appropriate sizes to match the mayflies we’re seeing.  Pheasant tails, copper johns and hare’s ears are great simple flies that do work.  We’re still seeing the same bugs with a few remaining Sulphurs on the upper West, especially before dark.  We have also been seeing good Blue Winged Olives in the #18-22 range, Isonychia in size #12 and some Hebes in the #16-18 size range.  Terrestrials like winged-ants are great options too.  The last few clear nights have had some great spinner falls as well.  The lower West and the upper mainstem are really benefitting from the cooler temps and are turning back on as they usually do.  The main is a great place to get back to and fish to some fish that haven’t been harassed too much the last several months and it should be a great fall down there.

The flow downriver at Hale Eddy we have 828 cfs and 51 degrees.  The West Branch is showing the late summer/early fall stain which is typical this time of year and will be around for a while but there is still 3-4 of visibility on sunny days and will help with the streamer fishing.

With the cooler weather lately we’ve had some decent fishing with the usual fall bugs.  Blue Winged Olives in the 18-22 range have been prevalent, especially on cloudy days like tomorrow.  We are also seeing some hebes which are typically great summer/fall bugs in the 16-18 range.  The Isos are still around and make great blind casting flies if nothing is happening on top and work well to support a dropper.

The water levels have been very consistent lately with no rain events but it does look like we will get a little later afternoon, around 3pm, and they’re calling for a quarter inch.  With the current cloud cover it could make for a decent day on the water.

Water temps are looking good and will only get better downriver with these cool nights coming up.  The upper West at Stilesville is running 646 cfs and 50 degrees, up a bit due to the increase in release from Cannonsville which started early this morning.

The mainstem at Lordville is running 1080 cfs and 66 degrees.  You can still find a few #18 Sulphurs upriver as the hatch is winding down for the year, usually mixed with some Olives and the occasional Cahill and Isonychia.  You’ll see the same bugs downriver as well with a few less Sulphurs, especially mid-day, but blind casting those larger Isos has been working.  The dropper off of the Iso, say an unweighted pheasant tail or Iso nymph, has been working well when fished in likely holding water and riffs.  The winged-ants are just getting going and is typically a great hatch once the fish really get keyed in on them which can take a few days of them being on the water.

Water levels have dropped consistently on the rivers which were puffed up yesterday due to the rain Sunday night.  The upper West Branch at Stilesville is running 510 cfs and 51 degrees while down at Hale Eddy we have 687 cfs and 54 degrees.  The East Branch upriver at Harvard is running 194 cfs and 60 degrees and down at Fishs’ Eddy we have 340 cfs and 71 degrees.  The main Delaware at Lordville is running 1140 cfs and 73 degrees.  With the sunny skies today the fishing on top is going to be tough and we can hope for a few bugs and cooperative fish.  The Sulphur hatch on the upper river is slowing down and although you can find some bugs there in the afternoon the fish eating them have been pretty small lately with the majority of larger fish waiting till later to show their faces.  Pretty typical this time of year and as we start to get some cooler temps later this month the lower West, and eventually the upper main, begins to look better and better.  The pressure the fish have received over the last few months is much less downriver versus the no-kill area.  You’ll still see the same bugs, Olives, Isonychia and Cahills with a few Sulphurs on the lower river, just not a great mid-day hatch.  Blind casting the riffs with Isos or running a dropper underneath a big fly has been producing fish lately.  Nymphing can also be very good during the middle of the day.  It looks like we are in for some rain tomorrow afternoon, they’re calling for over an inch, starting around noon, which could be good to bring the river up a bit and improve on at least the streamer fishing.

The slight stain will definitely help with the streamer fishing if that’s your thing or if you’re tired of the upriver Sulphur game.  The slight increase in water should also help with the dry fly game as well, speeding everything up a bit.  There are still a few Sulphurs around up in the Deposit area in the #18-20 range with a lot of smaller fish to deal with as the mid-summer conditions continue.  It looks like it’s going to cool down a bit going into the weekend which should help a bit, especially the lower West and upper Mainstem.

We do still have good cloud cover that is supposed to stick around which make for a good day with the Blue Winged Olives, typically in the 18-22 size.

Mornings have been productive with streamers if you are up at daybreak until 7:30 or so and usually about that time you can find a few fish feeding on top taking any surface but that comes down their lane.  This early there’s not really a hatch, more likely they’re rising to bugs from the night before or terrestrials are always good flies - like ants and beetles.  There have been some Tricos on the lower West, main and East Branch in the mornings usually showing up about this same time.  The upper West is still getting some decent Sulphurs starting around noon, give or take an hour, and will come and go throughout the afternoon.  As usual with the summer Sulphurs up top a lot of the fish are feeding on nymphs coming up through the water column, oftentimes right at the surface, causing you to see random body parts like fins and backs.  Droppers like pheasant tails, soft hackles or traditional wet flies fished as a dropper off the back of a visible dry fly.  We should have some Olives today as well due to the cloud cover, usually in the #18-22 range, and fish will look for the Olives even during a good Sulphur hatch.  The lower half of the West is seeing some Olives, Cahills and Isonychia,  with the Olives being the most prolific.  The Isos are great blind casting flies to cover some water if not much is happening on top and will bring fish up if you focus on getting good drifts and covering water.

The Sulphurs upriver will be an option, starting around noon, but with the cloud cover and rain it would be nice to see some Olives and get a little activity on the lower West as well.  Mornings are good if you can get out - streamers from sunrise ‘till the sun pokes out, usually a few fish trash-feeding, then some Tricos if you’re lucky enough to find a few and they drop.  The lower West, main and East Branch are your best bet for the Tricos which are decent at times.  Blind casting some bigger bugs or terrestrials is also a good method to drum some fish up on those stretches as well.  Nymphing has been productive with pheasant tails and Iso nymphs too.  We’ll see what the rain does the next couple days and we may have some decent streamer fishing soon.  Lotsa’ Luck, , \n",

      "We’ve got a nice morning to start the week off with temps in the upper-50’s and a high later around 80.  It looks like today is going to be clear all day and then tomorrow some clouds moving in throughout the day and a chance of some rain late Tuesday and into Wednesday which could make for some great conditions.  We’ve been pretty dry up here lately aside from a brief afternoon shower here and there.  Water levels on the West Branch are back to their normal levels which we’ve had for weeks now with Stilesville on the upper river just under 600 cfs and Hale Eddy just above with a temp of 50.  The upper East Branch is running 194 cfs and 58 degrees at Harvard and down at Fishs’ Eddy we are looking at 286 cfs and 67 degrees.  Lordville on the mainstem is running 981 cfs and 68 degrees.  These cooler mornings really help to keep downstream temps on the cool side and oftentimes there are some fish trash-feeding before the sun pops out, taking leftover bugs from the night before or terrestrials.  There have also been some Tricos in size #20-24 around on the lower West, upper main and the East - we just don’t see them on the upper West’s colder water.  Sulphurs around Deposit (upper West) are still the main bugs we’re looking for mid-day, usually starting around noon give or take an hour.  As most of you know the Sulphur-eaters are pretty picky and will test the patience of all but is a great place to find good bugs and rising fish mid-day.  Cahills and Isos are also great flies to pack for these later summer months and are great for covering water if there isn’t much happening.  The rain which might pass through this week could be a big help and a day or two of stained water would be a welcomed sight.  Lotsa’ Luck, , \n",

Water levels are remaining consistent as we’ve got very little rain lately, only a bit Tuesday into Wednesday morning which soaked right in the ground.  Stilesville on the upper West Branch is running 597 cfs and 49 degrees and down at Hale Eddy we have 606 cfs and 50 degrees to start the weekend.  The upper East at Harvard is running 197 cfs and 59 degrees and down at Fishs’ Eddy we are looking at 316 cfs and 68 degrees.  The main Delaware at Lordville is running 1020 and 69 degrees this morning.  We’ve still had some decent mid-day Sulphurs the last few days up around Deposit starting to show up early-afternoon.  As usual the fish beyond picky on the Sulphurs and will require all the tricks you know to be successful.  Droppers and wets in the film work well when the fish are feeding right below the surface, just try different patterns and the length of the dropper is also important.  It’s also a good time to try lower on the West and expect less bugs and less fish rising mid-day but when you do find them they are usually easier as they can’t be as picky as the trout during a prolific hatch.   Ants and beetles are great flies for those random risers.  Isonychia and Cahills are also good flies to prospect with or put over the fish feeding but there isn’t a specific happening.  They say we may get a bit of rain later tomorrow but the afternoon thunderstorms are always possible but not very reliable.  Lotsa’ Luck, , \n",

We did get a bit of an increased release from Cannonsville reservoir into the West Branch with the current flow up at Stilesville running 725 cfs and 49 degrees and down at Hale Eddy we have 773 cfs and 51 degrees.  The West Branch is going to be where you want to be with these high air temps unless you want to hit the upper East which is pretty low with 206 cfs up at Harvard and 61 degrees this morning.  Downriver at Fishs’ Eddy we have 348 cfs and 73 degrees.  The main Delaware at Lordville is running 1210 cfs and 70 degrees.  The extra water into the West Branch is a great thing and will help to cool down the whole river, especially below Deposit.  The mid-day bugs up around Deposit should kick off around noon or so and continue ‘till the evening.  Keep your droppers and soft hackles handy as the fish are feeding below the surface a lot of the time and dropping those flies off the back of a good Sulphur dry can be very effective.  The Cahills and Isonychia will be around for a while and are always great for the random risers or to blind-cast with if not much is happening.  Nymphing with small Sulphur nymphs or pheasant tails is also effective if that’s your thing or if no fish are rising.  It looks like the weather is going to cool off a bit overnight and the next few days are in the upper-70’s.  Lotsa’ Luck, , \n",

The East up at Harvard is running 219 cfs and 61 degrees and down at Fishs’ Eddy we are looking at 383 cfs and 70 cfs. The mainstem at Lordville is running 1100 cfs and 68 degrees to start the day. We’re still looking at Sulphurs in #18-20 and the upper West is going to be the best bet mid-day with bugs usually starting to show around 11am-1pm, depending on conditions, and go from there with spinners at dark. There are still some Cahills and Isos around too for the random risers or for blind-casting.

The upper East Branch at Harvard is running 213 cfs and 59 degrees and down at Fishs’ Eddy the flow is 388 cfs and 68 degrees.  Lordville down on the mainstem is currently 1100 cfs and 68 degrees.  With the sun and clear skies the Deposit area is going to be the place to be mid-day for some Sulphur activity.  If you want to nymph or fish subsurface the lower half of the West is still cool and in great shape and you will see some random fish feeding and Isos and Cahills will be great bugs to put over them or even blind cast in the moving water with a lot less people compared to the upper river.  Droppers off of those bigger flies works well too if you want to double up with a #18 pheasant tail for a Sulphur nymph.  The bugs upriver have been starting late morning/early afternoon depending on the day with #18-20 Sulphurs in good numbers which will come and go through the afternoon.

These cool mornings are a nice time to get out before the sun burns off the fog for a few hours of fishing and nymphing and streamer fishing are usually pretty good and most likely you will have the river to yourself.  The Deposit area has been the place to be mid-day with some #18-20 Sulphurs starting to show up early afternoon in decent numbers but be prepared for some picky eaters.  Cripples, droppers and your favorite emerger patterns will helpful along with some patience and good drifts.  We are still getting some Isonychia in #10-12 along with some #14-16 Cahills too.  Their spinners are also good patterns for the evening along with Sulphur spinners which tend to drop in large numbers when they do.  Small ants and beetles are great flies this time of year and as we move towards August be on the lookout for winged-ants which are as good as any hatch when they’re around.  Nymphing with small Sulphur-specific nymphs and pheasant tails is always a good option if the bugs are slow.  It looks like pretty similar weather all weekend with no rain in the forecast.

The West up at Stilesville is running 597 cfs and 48 degrees while down at Hale Eddy we have 828 cfs and 53 degrees with a slight stain to the water and as you come across feeder streams you’ll likely have a bit coming out of them for a while.

On the lower East at Fishs’ Eddy we have 876 cfs and 65 degrees, again a big improvement with more water and cooler temps.  The main Delaware at Lordville is running 1640 cfs and 63 degrees.  We should have some good Blue Winged Olives today in size #18-22 with the cloud cover and you can expect good Sulphurs in #18, especially around Deposit from early afternoon on.  The Isonychia in size #10-12 will be around for a while and are always great blind-casting flies and are also great flies to support a dropper if that’s your thing.

On the bug front not much has changed over the last week with some Sulphurs starting in the early afternoon and upriver around Deposit being the place to be for the most bugs and cool water temps.  As we’ve moved into summer weather the mornings have a good time to be on the water with a few fish trash-feeding on leftover bugs from the night before and are usually less picky than the fish during the middle of a hatch.  Small spinners and terrestrials are always good choices for the morning fish.  During the Sulphur hatch the fish are picky as usual and having a good selection of cripples, patience and sub-surface flies to use as droppers is essential.  Isonychia and Cahills are good bugs are still around and make great flies for that randomly rising fish you don’t want to spend a ton of time on or also make great blind casting flies.

Iso nymphs or a Zug Bug in the appropriate size are great nymphs, also small Sulphur nymphs or pheasant tails work well too.

We are also seeing a few Grey Fox in #14-16, small #18-22 Blue Winged Olives and some #10 Isonychia sporadically throughout the afternoon.  As usual in July the fish have their A-game at eating bugs and creative Sulphur patterns like cripples and subsurface emergers really help.  Especially when you have lots of Sulphurs on the water the larger fish will only pick of the most vulnerable stages.  The nymphing can be really good at these levels with the highly defined riffles and seams with small Sulphur nymphs or even a larger Iso that can be dead drifted or swung in the current.  Blind casting the Isos can also be very effective, especially from the boat when you’re moving down river.  They are calling for some cloud cover to pick up as the day goes on with some rain tomorrow afternoon which would really be the best case scenario.

Luckily we have lots of cold water in the system to help pad against the high air temps and we should have a good day on the water.  Even in the high sun we’ve been getting some good bugs mid-afternoon and the fish are looking up.  They have continued to step down the flow up at Stilesville on the West Branch and we are currently looking at 1150 cfs and 46 degrees while down at Hale Eddy we have 1330 cfs and 48 degrees.  At these levels those who know the river are going to find plenty of places to get in and wade, maybe not all the way across the river but enough to make it happen.  The East up at Harvard is now running 860 cfs and 49 cfs and down at Fishs’ Eddy we are looking at 1730 cfs and 57 degrees.  The main Delaware down at Lordville is now running 3500 cfs and 58 degrees.  These are really great levels and water temps heading into July with all of the rivers fishable and fishing well.  We are still getting Sulphurs in the #14-16 range with a few #18’s starting to show up and will eventually take over the mid-day bug program up around Deposit.  Nymphing before the hatch gets going is working pretty well with small Sulphur imitations or pheasant tails.  We are seeing a few larger #14 Cahills mixed in as well as some #10 Isonychia which are always great blind-casting flies.  With these warm, calm evenings we are getting some spinners of the above bugs along with some more hatching as well.

We’ve got some color throughout the system, not muddy but a nice chalky haze to the river with 4-5’ of visibility depending on where you are.  Some feeders are still pumping dirty water into the system so below them you will have a bit of mud before it mixes as it moves downstream.

The Delaware system will continue to fish very well in the higher water, although it’s hard to say what will happen today after the sudden rise in water.  Likely it will be very good, especially after the fish have a bit of time to acclimate to the near tripling of water running through their home.  The last two days on the system fished very well, especially for mid-June.  We are seeing #14-16 Sulphurs, #10 March Browns, some Greeen and Brown Drakes, Olives and Isonychia.

Most of the river system has been getting into that summer/mid-June mode without many mid-day bugs but some activity towards dark and nymphing to fill in the voids.  At the same time the upper West is starting to fish a little better mid-day as we finish June and move into the July Sulphurs which should just pick up as we move forward.  We are also seeing a few March Browns and Isonychia as well which are great for blind casting.

As far as bugs you should expect #14-16 Sulphurs, #18-20 Olives, #8-10 March Browns, #18 Tan caddis  and a few Drakes on the main Delaware and East Branch.

      "We’ve got a little drizzle to which just started around 7:30 this morning and it looks like it will last until 1 pm or so and some more light rain in the afternoon hours with temps in the upper-60’s.  Sounds like a fine day for fishing.  Yesterday was another solid day and last night was about as good as it gets with plenty of bugs and no shortage of fat fish feeding on top.  Water levels are still at a great level for both wade fishing and floating.  The upper West Branch at Stilesville is running 669 cfs and 47 degrees while down at Hale Eddy we have 847 cfs and 48 degrees.  The upper East at Harvard is at 284 cfs and 53 degrees and down lower at Fishs’ Eddy we have 1050 cfs and 58 degrees.  The West Branch fished well all weekend with good bugs even in the sunny weather with tons of Tan, Charcoal and Apple caddis in all stages of life.  We are still seeing the tail end of the Hendrickson hatch with plenty of spinners the last few nights.  There are some Olives and even some Blue Quills on the upper West Branch too.  The main and East Branch have been a bit slower in the bright sun, as they normally are, especially as we are getting to the end of May.  Today should be a much better day to be on those rivers with perfect, buggy conditions with the warm air and light, on-and-off drizzle.  We’ve been getting  some March Browns and a few Sulphurs down there too.  It looks like clouds and rain later in the day for the next couple days which should lead to some excellent days on the water.  Lotsa’ Luck , , \n",

      "Today is starting out bright and sunny after a clear night with air temps in the low-50’s with some cloud cover throughout the day.  The rivers are all in great shape with nice and wadeable flows throughout the system.  The upper West Branch at Stilesville is running 701 cfs and 48 degrees with great clarity and down at Hale Eddy we have 951 cfs 48 degrees.  The upper East at Harvard is running 307 this morning and 51 degrees while down at Fishs’ Eddy we have 1150 cfs and 57 degrees.  The main Delaware is running 2550 cfs and 57 degrees.  Yesterday was another solid day on the water with plenty of bugs and some great fish being caught.  We are seeing tons of caddis throughout the day with some #18 Tan and Charcoal caddis and spent caddis are always great options.  The upper West is still getting some Hendricksons in the afternoon hours and plenty of spinners too.  Rusty spinners in general in 10-18 are required flies this time of year.  We are seeing some #8-10 March Browns as well, and that’s were those larger spinners will come in handy.  For those down on the lower sections of the main we are starting to see a few #14-16 Sulphurs too.  It looks like Tuesday is going to be an overcast and rainy which is great news for those who own rain jackets.  Lotsa’ Luck, , \n",

We had a great day on the water yesterday with a bit of wind but plenty of bugs and beautiful fish being caught.  All of the wade fishermen should be happy with the lower water and plenty of wading opportunities throughout the system.  The upper West at Stilesville is now at 701 cfs and 48 degrees while Hale Eddy is running 1140 cfs adn 48 degrees as well.  The upper East Branch at Harvard is down to 337 cfs and 51 degrees and the lower is running 1250 cfs and 56 degrees at Fishs’ Eddy.  The main at Lordville is down to 2680 cfs and 55 degrees.  The bugs really haven’t changed too much lately with some March Browns showing up throughout the system and some Hendricksons, Olives and Paraleps still on the West.  There have also been some #16 Brown Stoneflies mixed into the bug soup.  With all of the hatching we’ve had some great spinner falls lately, with all of the bugs turning into Rusty Spinners of appropriate sizes.  A #16 Rusty Spinner is a hard fly to beat this time of year, despite whats on the water.  Lotsa’ Luck, , \n",

We are still seeing  the same bugs with Hendricksons, Olives and Blue Quills on the West and some March Browns on the main, East and lower West.  We should also see some spinners tonight with low winds and temps in the evening in the upper-60’s.  Nymphing should also be effective with the lower water levels throughout the system.

The last few days have been very good with similar weather and no shortage of bugs or fish rising most of the day.  We really avoided those storms of yesterday with minimal rainfall.

There is great visibility on all rivers and we’ve been getting great bugs lately.  The West has been very good with good Hendricksons #14-16, Blue Quills #16-18, Olives #18-20 and their rusty spinners usually later in the day.  We are seeing a lot of caddis throughout the day and a few spent caddis are good flies to pack along.  The main and East are getting some March Browns in the #8-10 range as well.

The whole system is also getting some great hatches of tan and charcoal colored caddis in the #16 range.

The West Branch dropped a lot over the last 24 hours and is much clearer today, perfect for fishing, and should continue to fish well after the high water we had yesterday.  The upper West at Stilesville is now at 2420 cfs and 53 degrees which is has been rising over the last 24hrs due to the delay of the spill coming over the reservoir from the storm.  Hale Eddy has dropped steadily and is now at 3130 cfs and 47 degrees with plenty of visibility.  The upper East at Harvard, which never got hit on Sunday, is now at 927 cfs and 47 degrees and below the Beaverkill at Fishs’ Eddy we are looking at 2170 cfs and 53 degrees.  The main down at Lordville is now running 5740 cfs and 52 degrees.  Other than the West Branch and Mainstem being a little higher we are back to where we were last week as far as fishing and should expect pretty good surface activity with still strong Hendricksons, Olives, Blue Quills along with Tan Caddis in the #16 range, and some smaller Charcoal caddis in the #18 range.  Spinners of the mayflies could be on the water at any time later today due to the cooler temps, so make sure you have plenty of Rusty Spinners in #14-18.  The forecast looks pretty good for this week with rising temps as we go towards the weekend with a chance of rain on Thursday.  Lotsa’ Luck, , \n",

We got hit pretty good on the West Branch here with last nights storms but the East Branch and even Beaverkill didn’t get hit as bad and went up very little.  The upper West Branch at Stilesville is now running 2000 cfs and 52 degrees, which is up about 120 cfs.  The West down at Hale Eddy is up to 4270 cfs and 51 degrees and is very turbid with minimal visibility.  Oquaga creek up on the West is a big contributor to the muddy conditions but everything will clear up pretty quickly and currently there are miles of clear water to fish.  The upper East at Harvard is now at 1000 cfs and 50 degrees while down at Fishs’ Eddy we are looking at 2200 and 56 degrees with minimal turbidity throughout the whole East Branch.  It looks like the Beaverkill only went up a couple hundred cfs overnight and is now at 1070.  The mainstem at Lordville was running 4810 cfs and 55 degrees but will go up as the water from the West makes it’s way down there.

We are still looking at Hendricksons, Olives and Blue Quills for the main hatches with lots of caddis which can be important, especially if there are a lack of mayflies earlier in the day.  A few March Browns too on the lower East and Mainstem.  It looks like a good night for spinners which will all be rusty in the appropriate sizes.

We may get another shot of rain over the next hour but the rest of the day looks like cloud cover and upper-60’s for the air temp.  Yesterday was bright and sunny with no clouds which isn’t ideal.  The West Branch at Stilesville is currently 2040 cfs and 53 degrees, steadily climbing as Cannonsville spills.  The West down at Hale Eddy has actually dropped a bit with a flow of 2740 cfs and 46 degrees.

We’ve had excellent bugs this week, obviously better with clouds and light rain, and today should be no different.  We’re still seeing #14-16 Hendricksons, #18-20 Olives, #16-18 Blue Quills, a few March Browns in the #10-12 range just getting going and lots of  Apple and Chimarra caddis throughout the system.

After three days of 40-degree weather with steady, light rain the warmer temps are nice to have.  Despite the crumby weather we had some good fishing and lots of bugs.  Yesterday was on of the better bug days you’ll ever see here and the fish were feeding on top all afternoon.  There have been lots of phone calls the past few days concerning the weather and people surprised there were great bugs and fish feeding in the all-day-rains.  Those days are always so much better than any bright and sunny day - if you like to catch fish at least.  It’s pretty amazing that this is shocking to people.  If you shy away from fishing when it’s rainy or cool you’re going to miss some of best days with minimal pressure.  The next couple days look dry and in the 60’s so we should have some good fishing.

Rusty spinners, which all of the above mayflies will molt into, in the sizes of the appropriate mayfly are must-haves for this time of year  You just have to put your time in and observe while getting good drifts with some different bugs.  The streamer fishing is still solid and will get better with a little stain if the rain does increase.  It does look like a little rain throughout the week but that’s nothing new and not a terrible thing with the quality of fishing we’ve had during the last month of the same.  Lotsa’ Luck, , \n",

      "After last nights rain the rivers look good, most areas have a bit more color, but overall the rain didn’t do much to the levels or turbidity.  Even thought the dry fly fishing  has been excellent the stain should help the streamer game a bit.  No more rain is in the forecast today but lots of clouds and temps near 70 which is ideal.  Stilesville on the upper West Branch is now 1710 cfs and 46 degrees while down at Hale Eddy we have 2430 cfs and 44 degrees, up only a few hundred cfs.  The East is looking good too with 1030 cfs and 46 degrees up at Harvard while Fishs’ Eddy is now 2380 and 49 degrees.  The main at Lordville is now 5340 cfs and 48 degrees.  If you have access to something to float in conditions couldn’t be better and the fish and bugs are about as good as it gets.  We are still seeing the same bugs with Hendricksons, Olives, Blue Quills and some caddis.  There have been lots of bugs on the water with several different stages they could be feeding on - from Olive emeregers to cripples or spinners.  Paying attention the fish feeding will really help in these situations when they get picky.  We should have another great day.  Lotsa’ Luck, , \n",

We could also see spinners, all Rusty, any time during the day.  We are seeing a few #16-18 Stoneflies and Chimarra caddis but with the mayflies on the water we’ve been seeing the stones and caddis are pretty much irrelevant.  The streamer fishing conditions are still very good but once the bugs start who’s throwing streamers?

The streamer fishing was pretty good this past weekend after the rains of Friday and Saturday and we even had good dry fly fishing in the afternoon hours if you hung in there.  The Blue Winged Olives in #18-20 and Blue Quills in #16-18 have been very good the last few weeks, we are also seeing #14-16 Hendricksons which should be good this week with the warmer temps.  We are also seeing a few #16-18 Black Stoneflies still around and small Chimarra caddis in the #18-20 range which aren’t as important on top if the water is covered in Olives.

The rivers have been dropping all week and the fishing has been good and we’ve had pretty good bugs all week.  The overcast and rain will definitely help the streamer bite.  This time of year the crumby days are oftentimes the best, especially on top. The upper West Branch at Stilesville is flowing 2080 cfs and 48 degrees and downriver at Hale Eddy 2520 cfs and 44 degrees.

It looks pretty dry most of the week with some minor rain possible towards the weekend.  As of now it doesn’t look like anything too significant if any at all, exactly what we need to get the flows down.  As far as bugs we’re pretty much on schedule for a normal year with Blue Winged Olives, some Blue Quills, Caddis and a few Hendricksons around which will likely pick up with these warm temps coming up.  The upper West at Stilesville is dropping slowly with clear water and a flow of 3470 cfs and 44 degrees to start the day - a bit warmer than usual due to the volume of warm-water spilling from the surface of the reservoir.  The West Branch down at Hale Eddy is now 4420 cfs and 44 degrees today with good visibility.  At these levels we are going to be streamer fishing to cover water and looking for some rising fish in the afternoon hours in the slower areas of the river.  The East Branch at Harvard is running 3050 cfs and 43 degrees and down at Fishs’ Eddy we have 5880 cfs and 46 degrees.  The East still has some decent stain to it as does the Beaverkill which is running 2000 this morning.  The rivers will continue to drop slowly throughout the week with no rain events but will be far from wadeable for a while.  With both reservoirs spilling we will be getting significant releases along with the spill.  Only when the spilling is over will they start to cut the releases back.

We are in pretty good shape considering the rain we got, with good fishable water now via boat.  We won’t be wading for a while which is very common this time of year and to be expected.

With the sunnier weather for today we could see a few more stoneflies int he #16-18 range and we’ve been seeing a few Paraleps/Blue Quills in the #16-18 range which should pick up in the coming days.  There have been a few Hendricksons #14-16 around randomly but with this coming week’s temps we could start to see more of them and Quill Gordons #12-14 any day now.  The Beaverkill did get hit pretty good with the rain so the lower East will likely get some stain throughout the day.  Lotsa’ Luck, , \n",

      "We have some cloud cover to start this Friday morning with a bit of wind out of the southeast.  The forecast is calling for warmer temps than yesterday with highs in the upper-50’s and wind peaking out at 13mph in the afternoon.  The release on the West and East Branches did go up a bit overnight, likely anticipating the rain tonight, which is likely to make Cannnonsville (99.2% full) and Pepacton (99.7%) spill in the coming days.  Stilesville is now running 929 cfs and 39 degrees and down at Hale Eddy we have 1190 cfs and 40 degrees.  The East Branch is running 788 cfs up at Harvard and 40 degrees and below the Beaverkill at Fishs’ Eddy we’ve got 2030 cfs and 41 degrees.  The mainstream at Lordville is currently running 3650 cfs and 41 degrees.  The temps outside yesterday peaked in the mid-40’s with good cloud cover an the fishing was great.  Tons of Blue Winged Olives in the #18-20 range all afternoon, as good of a hatch as you will ever see and the fish were eating them.  It’s good testament that once the hatches get going early season a cooler day with crumby weather isn’t a bad thing and oftentimes ends up being a great thing, especially when the majority of angler don’t go out cause they’re scared of a little weather.  The main point is, sunny days are never going to fish as well as the days with bad weather despite the temperature.  There are still some stoneflies around in the #16-20 range and a dark Elk Hair Caddis works well for them.  There have been a few Blue Quills #16-20 around and even the odd Hendrickson.  The next week should be a good one and it’s a pretty safe bet to expect the water to rise with the rain coming and change to the reservoirs.  As for the streamer fishing a little stain would help.  The fish have seen a fair amount of streamers lately and the water is clear.  Lotsa’ Luck, , \n",

      "Today is starting out a bit cooler than the last few days we’ve had with a current temp of 36 degrees with a bit of cloud cover.  It’s supposed to hit 46 later this afternoon.  We’ve had some good fishing lately for the second week of April with some solid streamer fishing and a few fish eating dries later in the day.  Obviously the quality of fishing this time of year is really dependent on the air temp and weather of the given day.  Flows are holding steady with 741 up at Stilesville on the West Branch and 39 degrees.  Hale Eddy is running 1030 cfs and 41 degrees this morning.  The upper East Branch up at Harvard is running 643 cfs and 42 degrees while down at Fishs’ Eddy we have 2780 cfs and 43 degrees.  The mainstream at Lordville is running 4870 cfs and 44 degrees.  Today is likely to be a decent streamer day and for those with boats the fishing now is all about covering water, so longer floats are going to pay off.  We should have some bugs this afternoon and we can only hope the fish are looking up.  Tomorrow the temps get back into the 50’s and continue to creep up into the weekend.  Lotsa’ Luck, , \n",

      "This morning is starting out a bit cloudy with the sun starting to poke through and burn off the fog with a temp in the low-40’s.  It’s nice it didn’t get below freezing last night which helps keep the water temp up a bit.  Temps today are going to peak in the low-60’s this afternoon with some rain coming from 2-4pm.  The flows are remaining pretty steady with 817 cfs and 39 up at Stilesville on the West and down at Hale Eddy we are looking at 1130 cfs and 41 degrees.  The upper East at Harvard is now 719 cfs and 42 degrees and below the Beaverkill (1560 cfs) at Fishs’ Eddy we have 2580 cfs and 44 degrees.  The main Delaware at Lordville is now 4450 cfs and 45 degrees.  We should have another good day on the water, hopefully the rain doesn’t affect the bugs in afternoon, which is coming right when we are getting the majority of fish coming up durning the warmest part of the day.  The streamer fishing has been good, as conditions are ideal with a slight stain/tint to the water which is typical this time of year with all of the feeder streams running full.  We’re still looking at #18-22 Blue Winged Olives and some Dark Stoneflies in the #16-20 range but if we keep getting these warm temps it won’t be too long before we start to see some Blue Quills and Hendricksons.

      "Today is looking like an excellent day to be on the water with lots of cloud cover and warm air temps overnight with a high of 69 degrees later today.  We did get some rain overnight but it didn’t affect the rivers at all turbidity-wise, everything is still looking great.  We currently have 929 cfs up at Stilesville with a temp of 39 to start the day.  Down at Hale Eddy we are looking at 1270 cfs and 41 degrees.  The upper East is running 686 cfs and 43 degrees at Harvard and downriver at Fishs’ Eddy we have 2080 cfs and 46 degrees - pretty nice temps for a morning in April.  The mainstream at Lordville is running 3670 cfs and 47 degrees this morning.  The streamer fishing has been pretty good lately with warmer temps this past weekend and there are bugs around in the afternoon.  These warmer water temps are really going to get things going and it looks like the air temps this week are going to be great and no snow which is a plus.  Today and tomorrow are going to be cloudy with a chance of rain tomorrow afternoon which is perfect weather for the Blue Winged Olives.  There have been pretty good Stoneflies around too in the #16-20 range and a dark-bodied elk hair caddis are great dries when they’re on the water.  Lotsa’ Luck, , \n",

      "Today is starting out with some cloud cover and a temp in the mid-30’s with a high this afternoon of 55 degrees and clearing throughout the day.  We did have some snow and then rain most of yesterday but the rivers remained pretty steady.  Stilesville on the upper West is 817 cfs and 38 degrees and down at Hale Eddy it’s running 1100 cfs and 38 degrees.  The upper East at Harvard is now 456 cfs and 37 degrees while the lower East at Fishs’ Eddy is running 1630 cfs and 37 as well.  The main Delaware at Lordville is running 3250 cfs and 37 degrees.  Clarity throughout the system is good with a spring green tint to the water.  Today is warmest day we’ve had all week and should be a good recipe for some bugs later in the day.  The temps for the next few days coming up look great so we should start to get a bit more consistency as the water temps warm.  Nymphing and streamer fishing will also pick up as the air temps warm up.  The bugs you’re likely to see are small Blue Winged Olives in the #18-22 range and small pheasant tails below the surface for their nymphs.  There are still some stoneflies around too and small Copper Johns or stonefly nymphs are good flies to bounce off of the bottom.  We should see these bugs later today and 3-6pm is going to be the warmest time on the water.  The streamer fishing is going to be popular for a while with the higher water.  Focus on the slower moving sections of water this time of year.  With the warm air temps for next week things will pick up quickly and should offer the last opportunity for some good fishing without the crowds.  Lotsa’ Luck  , , \n",

      "We’ve got some temps in the low 30’s to start the day with a high temp of 38 degrees later this afternoon.  There’s some precipitation moving our way, likely to hit around 10am, and we could get a couple inches of snow.  We do have some good cloud cover which helped keep the air temp up a bit overnight.  Stilesville is now running 817 cfs and 37 degrees, down at Hale Eddy we have 1100 cfs and 38 degrees.  The wind is also going to be pretty mild today, mostly under 10 mph, which is a plus after the high winds earlier this week.  The upper East Branch at Harvard is running 488 cfs and 38 degrees and down on the lower East at Fishs’ Eddy we have 1690 cfs and 40 degrees.  The mainstem at Lordville is running 3310 cfs and 41 degrees.  The fishing today could be decent and the water on the upper East and West Branch are wadeable.  The reservoirs are all very full and will more than likely start spilling early next week, making the chance to wade anywhere on the Delaware system pretty tough if not impossible.  The weekend temps look a lot better than what we’ve been getting this week with highs Saturday in the mid-50’s and Sunday in the mid-60’s.  Still Olives and stoneflies will be the bugs until we get some more days with warmer temps.  The hatches this year seem to be on schedule with a normal year with more mayfly activity picking up the second to third week of April.  It looks like next week’s temps are in the 60’s with much warmer temps at night which is just as important as the daytime temps.  Lotsa’ Luck   , , \n",

The upper East went up to 488 cfs and 38 degrees and at Fishs’ Eddy we have 1870 cfs and 40 degrees down on the main at Lordville.  The wind today is going to be much more friendly to us compared to yesterday, peaking out in the afternoon at 13 mph.  Slowly fishing streamers or nymphing are going to be your best methods of fishing today, there could be a few bugs in the afternoon - still #18-22 Blue Winged Olives and #16-22 Stoneflies.  Tomorrow looks to be a bit cooler, in the upper-30’s with a few inches of snow mid-day.  Saturday and Sunday are going to be quite a bit warmer so should be good day to be on the river.

The rivers have dropped a bit with Stilesville running 669 cfs and 41 degrees, wadeable if you want to hit the West Branch.  As you go downriver, on all of the local rivers, you are simply going to have higher water with all of the feeder streams still flowing and full.

Today is going to be a tough day on the water with the high winds, around 30mph, but may die down a bit in the late afternoon and into evening.

We only talked with a few anglers yesterday and the fishing was obviously pretty tough, especially for those trying to nymph after the river almost doubled in size Sunday night.  There were very few bugs on the surface yesterday with temps most of the day around freezing.  The upper West Branch at Stilesville is now flowing 669 cfs and 37 degrees and downriver at Hale Eddy we have 1130 cfs and 37 as well.

Clarity on all of the rivers is very good with a nice green spring tint to the water.  We should see a few more bugs this afternoon with 3pm-5pm being the warmest part of the day.   Bugs to expect are still going to be small Blue Winged Olives in the #18-22 range as well as dark stoneflies in the #16-20 range.

      "Happy April first to everyone.  With the whole Delaware system open to fishing now, we look forward to another great season.  With these nice and warm air temps and sudden increase in the release on the West Branch we should have great dry fly fishing all day.  With the fish rising already this morning it should be a great day on the water, especially on April 1.  Just kidding, now for reality.   We’ve got a cold morning to start April with an air temp of 25 this morning (feels like 16 with wind) with some light flurries in the air with a high in the upper-30’s.  They did increase the flows/release overnight on the West Branch, bringing the river at Stilesville to 669 cfs and 37 degrees.  Hale Eddy is now up to 1320 cfs and 39 degrees.  The upper East Branch at Harvard is running 576 cfs and 37 degrees while downriver at Fishs’ Eddy we have 3000 cfs and 37 degrees as well.  The main Delaware at Lordville is running 5830 cfs and 38 degrees.  Fly fishing today under these conditions will be tough, with bottom-bouncing some nymphs or fishing streamers slow and deep being your best bet ‘till temps warm up a bit.  Small nymphs like pheasant tails in the 18-20 range as well as dark stonefly nymphs in the same size are going to be your best bet for nymphing.  The good news is that the temps are going to be quite a bit warmer, in the 50’s most of the days, with temps increasing as the week winds down.   It looks to be pretty dry with some possible rain Friday.  Lotsa’ Luck, , \n",

      "We’ve got a rainy morning with air temps dropping throughout the day and into tonight, with temps bottoming out in the mid-20’s.  The rivers are all currently in great shape with some color from the recent rains  and runoff but there are still some wading opportunities on the upper East and West Branches.  Tomorrow, April 1st, the upper East and West Branch (PA border upstream) open to fishing for the year.  The upper West Branch at Stilesville is running 203 cfs and 39 degrees and downriver at Hale Eddy we have 958 cfs and 43 degrees.  Hale Eddy has some color to it, not dirty but the deep green color of spring runoff.  The upper East Branch at Harvard is 591 cfs and 43 degrees and down below the Beaverkill (2200 cfs) at Fishs’ Eddy we have 3380 cfs and 42 degrees.  The mainstream at Lordville is running 5480 cfs an 44 degrees.  With several warm days this week the fishing was decent in the afternoons with some fish even looking up to small Blue Winged Olives in the #18-20 range as well as some Stoneflies in the #16-18 range.  For the stoneflies on top a dark bodied caddis works very well.  Nymphing and streamer fishing will be your best bet for the remainder of the day.  Small, dark 16-20 Copper Johns or Stonefly nymphs would be good flies to start with.  Also, small Pheasant tails nymphs in the 18-20 range for the BWO’s will work.  For the streamers, many patterns will work and fishing them slow is going to be your best bet and even focusing on slower pools and deeper slots versus hitting the banks this time of year.  It looks like a day and a half of cooler weather and then back into the 50’s for the remainder of next week.

It looks like today is going to be clear all day and then tomorrow some clouds moving in throughout the day and a chance of some rain late Tuesday and into Wednesday which could make for some great conditions.  We’ve been pretty dry up here lately aside from a brief afternoon shower here and there.  Water levels on the West Branch are back to their normal levels which we’ve had for weeks now with Stilesville on the upper river just under 600 cfs and Hale Eddy just above with a temp of 50.  The upper East Branch is running 194 cfs and 58 degrees at Harvard and down at Fishs’ Eddy we are looking at 286 cfs and 67 degrees.  Lordville on the mainstem is running 981 cfs and 68 degrees.  These cooler mornings really help to keep downstream temps on the cool side and oftentimes there are some fish trash-feeding before the sun pops out, taking leftover bugs from the night before or terrestrials.  There have also been some Tricos in size #20-24 around on the lower West, upper main and the East - we just don’t see them on the upper West’s colder water.  Sulphurs around Deposit (upper West) are still the main bugs we’re looking for mid-day, usually starting around noon give or take an hour.  As most of you know the Sulphur-eaters are pretty picky and will test the patience of all but is a great place to find good bugs and rising fish mid-day.  Cahills and Isos are also great flies to pack for these later summer months and are great for covering water if there isn’t much happening.  The rain which might pass through this week could be a big help and a day or two of stained water would be a welcomed sight.  Lotsa’ Luck, , ', 0.0), ('Today is starting out with bright sun and temps in the low-60’s and it looks like we may get some cloud cover later in the day with highs in the mid-80’s.  Water levels are remaining consistent as we’ve got very little rain lately, only a bit Tuesday into Wednesday morning which soaked right in the ground.  Stilesville on the upper West Branch is running 597 cfs and 49 degrees and down at Hale Eddy we have 606 cfs and 50 degrees to start the weekend.  The upper East at Harvard is running 197 cfs and 59 degrees and down at Fishs’ Eddy we are looking at 316 cfs and 68 degrees.  The main Delaware at Lordville is running 1020 and 69 degrees this morning.  We’ve still had some decent mid-day Sulphurs the last few days up around Deposit starting to show up early-afternoon.  As usual the fish beyond picky on the Sulphurs and will require all the tricks you know to be successful.  Droppers and wets in the film work well when the fish are feeding right below the surface, just try different patterns and the length of the dropper is also important.  It’s also a good time to try lower on the West and expect less bugs and less fish rising mid-day but when you do find them they are usually easier as they can’t be as picky as the trout during a prolific hatch.   Ants and beetles are great flies for those random risers.  Isonychia and Cahills are also good flies to prospect with or put over the fish feeding but there isn’t a specific happening.  They say we may get a bit of rain later tomorrow but the afternoon thunderstorms are always possible but not very reliable.  Lotsa’ Luck, , ', 0.0), ('We’ve got another warm one today with highs later in the upper-80’s and some humidity.  We may get a little rain later today, they’re saying around 8pm with a possible accumulation of 1/2”.  We did get a bit of an increased release from Cannonsville reservoir into the West Branch with the current flow up at Stilesville running 725 cfs and 49 degrees and down at Hale Eddy we have 773 cfs and 51 degrees.  The West Branch is going to be where you want to be with these high air temps unless you want to hit the upper East which is pretty low with 206 cfs up at Harvard and 61 degrees this morning.  Downriver at Fishs’ Eddy we have 348 cfs and 73 degrees.  The main Delaware at Lordville is running 1210 cfs and 70 degrees.  The extra water into the West Branch is a great thing and will help to cool down the whole river, especially below Deposit.  The mid-day bugs up around Deposit should kick off around noon or so and continue ‘till the evening.  Keep your droppers and soft hackles handy as the fish are feeding below the surface a lot of the time and dropping those flies off the back of a good Sulphur dry can be very effective.  The Cahills and Isonychia will be around for a while and are always great for the random risers or to blind-cast with if not much is happening.  Nymphing with small Sulphur nymphs or pheasant tails is also effective if that’s your thing or if no fish are rising.
